## Abstract

Plants synthesize a multitude of diverse metabolites crucial for plant survival and adaptation with implications in various biological processes and applications in agriculture and human health. However, the identity of most plant metabolites and the genes involved in their synthesis and regulation remain unknown. Thus, improving our understanding of plant gene-metabolite functional relationships is needed to unlock higher plant productivity and stress tolerance. We used a multi-omics approach combining untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), LC-UV absorbance, and genome-wide association (GWA) to identify and characterize mass features and the alleles in genes responsible with their variation in the Sorghum Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP). Defense compounds, including salicylic acid (SA) and the dihydroxybenzoic acids (DHBAs), were identified. SA, 2,3 DHBA, and 2,5 DHBA levels are all variable dependent on genotype in the population. Additionally, several other compounds were identified including multiple flavonoids and dhurrin. Functional validation of both compound identities and gene functions were further explored via reverse genetics studies using a sequence-indexed EMS mutant population sorghum. The same untargeted LC-MS approach was used to profile a set of EMS mutants. One such mutant had a high-impact point mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE an important enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis allowing the identification of a suite of flavonoids. Cross validation between the EMS mutant population and association mapping allows efficient validation, or rejection, of candidate genes identified by association mapping. Comparisons between LC-MS and LC-UV association data also help validate and identify mass features of interest. Additionally, total absorbance at specific wavelengths or the ratio of two specific wavelengths were mapped to identify alleles in genes associated with absorbance variations and higher abundances of light-absorbing compounds. LC-UV total absorbance association mapping can be compared and applied to field hyperspectral data, thus providing another application for the wealth of hyperspectral data collected from field studies.

## Abstract

The plant immune system includes constitutive and induced responses, when the strict fine-tuning regulation is disrupted autoimmunity may occur, i.e. spontaneous initiation of plant defense response affecting plant performance. In a screening to look for developmental affected maize mutants we identified narrow odd dwarf (nod) and Liguleless narrow (Lgn); surprisingly, transcriptome analysis showed overrepresentation of defense related gene categories, suggesting autoimmunity in these mutants. Proteomic analysis of NOD and LGN immunoprecipitated complexes showed interaction with exocyst components and MAPKs, and NOD with LGN interaction, BiFC experiments showed plasma membrane localization of NOD, LGN and some interactors relating these proteins with MAPK signaling pathways. NOD is the maize ortholog of the Arabidopsis MCAs (Mid-Complementing Activity 1 and 2), which have been reported forming a calcium import channel, based on the 3D structure and the MLKL domain, recently MCA2 was proposed to be a hNLR protein. In addition, NOD was identified interacting with P. maydis effectors in a Y2H screen, suggesting that NOD may be an atypical NLR. To test whether NOD can produce cell death, we did transient expression in N. benthamiana, showing that NOD N-terminus domain is enough to produce cell death. To explore the nod and Lgn involvement in pathogen response we are using Setosphaeria turcica to infect mutants in different genetic backgrounds. We found differential expression patterns of pathogenesis-related genes in B73 and Mo17, suggesting that those proteins are preventing PR genes induction depending on genetic background. Next experiments with fungal effectors will give information about NOD and LGN function at molecular level during pathogen infection in maize.

## Abstract

Maize genetic transformation, especially that mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, is a crucial method for creating genetically modified varieties. Besides its extensive utilization for generating transgenic events, it is currently the method of choice to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 machinery into maize cells, allowing the production of genome-edited genotypes. In recent years, significant advancements in maize transformation protocols have been made. These developments have gained attention from both academic and industry organizations, resulting in the emergence of several public and private maize transformation laboratories and facilities worldwide. In 2019, we established maize transformation capabilities at the Genomics for Climate Change Research Center (GCCRC) in Campinas, Brazil, as part of a plant biotechnology pipeline using maize immature zygotic embryos of the model temperate inbred line B104. We observed a significant increase in transformation efficiency after incorporating the utilization of ternary vectors and morphogenic regulator genes (MR). The “altruist” method increases transformation efficiency and the number of fertile plants by avoiding the adverse effects caused by defective MR excision when using a single vector for the target and MR genes. With these optimizations, we can now transform and edit tropical maize lines more efficiently than B104. Seasonal variation has a significant impact on embryo production, which is highly correlated with transformation efficiency. Currently, we are testing a leaf-based protocol, which has shown promising results in overcoming this issue.

## Abstract

Maize endosperm development is characterized by an oxygen-deficient microenvironment, requiring molecular and biochemical mechanisms for hypoxia acclimation and maintenance. Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) catalyzes the conversion of (fructose + NADH)↔(sorbitol + NAD+) in endosperms during grain-fill. We hypothesize that SDH aids endosperm development in at least two ways, 1) by regenerating the NAD+ that maintains redox balance and glycolytic flux in the hypoxic endosperm, and 2) by enhancing sink strength through the metabolism of fructose and indirectly the import of its precursor sucrose. In support of our hypothesis, sorbitol accumulates in the endosperm region with lowest oxygen levels as determined by FTIR imaging in developing wild-type kernels. To evaluate the role of SDH, we characterized an Ac/Ds-induced sdh1 mutant which lacks detectable SDH activity and accumulates little to no sorbitol in kernels. We found that sdh1 mutant ears bear smaller kernels beginning at 15 DAP, with 13-17% less dry weight at maturity, suggesting an important role in kernel filling. Metabolic analysis of sdh1 mutant kernels shows elevated levels of fructose as well as sucrose (100% and 25% greater, respectively). Results indicate that conversion of fructose to sorbitol via SDH promotes sucrose metabolism and import. Work in progress focuses on characterization of Sdh1 over-expression lines, development of double-mutant kernels deficient in both sorbitol and starch biosynthesis, and an in-depth evaluation of metabolic impacts. Findings thus far highlight the role of SDH in kernel development with implications for metabolic engineering strategies to enhance sink strength and composition of the maize grain.

## Abstract

After domestication, maize was transported to the highlands of Mexico, where it crossed with a highland teosinte, Zea mays ssp. mexicana. This genomic introgression persists in modern maize inbreds and carries genes important for abiotic stress tolerance, particularly those involved in highland adaptation. Stresses typical of highland environments include high UV radiation, low temperature, and low phosphorus availability. Low-temperature stress, in particular, impacts the ability of tropical plants like maize to survive in colder environments. One way that plants adapt to low-temperature stress is through alterations in membrane lipids, which in turn impact membrane fluidity and structure. Using a biparental B73 x Palomero Toluqueño (a highland traditional maize variety from central Mexico) RIL population, we previously identified a gene, High Phosphatidylcholine 1 (hpc1), whose impaired function in highland maize impacts the amount of phosphatidylcholine, a key membrane lipid, and aids in highland adaptation. Here, we seek to quantify the extent of variation in membrane lipids and map the underlying genetic variation using a newly developed collection of introgression lines derived from crosses between B73 and hundreds of accessions of traditional maize varieties and teosintes from all across Latin America.

## Abstract

Plant meristems are developmental tissues that shape the structure of all plant organs. Aberrations in expression of meristematic genes as well as mutations in the proteins active in meristematic tissues could affect plant development. Understanding the relationships between meristem-specific genes and unveiling the regulatory mechanisms for their expression is essential to controlling plant development and breeding crops with desired characteristics. Liguleless genes are a group of meristem-specific genes affecting plant leaf development. A Liguleless5 (Lig5) mutation causes aberrations in the leaf ligule, a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and stem, changing the shape and the angle of seedling leaves. In addition, this mutation causes knot formation on leaves. In this project, we investigated the expression patterns of meristem-specific genes from several families (knotted, knotted-like, and liguleless) in meristematic and leaf tissues in lig5 mutant in comparison to the wildtype, to understand the possible causes of this phenotype. RNA was extracted from the meristematic (stem) and leaf tissues in young seedlings, converted into cDNA, and analyzed using qPCR to determine gene expression. We determined that several meristem-specific genes were overexpressed in the mutant leaf tissues and underexpressed in the mutant meristematic tissues compared to the wild-type plants. A few of those genes that expressed a change in expression patterns were kn1, knox1, knox2, and knox3. Our findings suggest that lig5 mutation causes changes in expression patterns of meristem-specific genes. Further studies are needed to understand the details of this effect.

## Abstract

Modulating gene expression is an essential tool for understanding biological processes and advancing the field of synthetic biology. This study investigates the efficacy of three methods in maize for stably activating gene transcription. The first method involves the designer Transcription Activator-Like effector (dTALe), a programmable protein functioning in specific DNA binding and gene activation. The second method uses the dead Cas9 (dCas9) activation, an alternative programable system for transcriptional modulation. The third one employs standard overexpression of a transgene of interest with a strong promoter. To assess the magnitude of transcriptional activation of targeted genes, we are developing transient expression of each approach. The goal of this project is to provide information to identify optimal strategies for achieving targeted gene activation in maize. Our poster will discuss what we have developed and the issues we encountered.

## Abstract

Southern leaf blight (SLB), a foliar disease of maize caused by the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus poses a significant threat to maize production globally. Tapping into the host genetic resistance proves to be a potent approach for managing SLB. There have been considerable efforts made towards identifying and elucidating the genes involved in SLB resistance, however, the mechanisms by which these genes operate are often uncertain. The intricate biochemical changes that transpire during plant-pathogen interactions bear significant biological relevance, making metabolomics an ideal tool for in-depth exploration. In this study we are using a set of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL’s) in the genetic background of the B73 inbred line, which are significantly more or less susceptible to SLB than B73 (2 more susceptible, 8 more resistant). The lines were phenotypically screened for SLB in 2019 and 2021 in both infected and uninfected conditions across the growing season. Inoculated and uninoculated samples collected at 2 time points post inoculation from both the seasons were subjected to an untargeted LC-MS/MS. Preliminary principal component analysis indicated a consistent clustering of the biological replicates by genotype, treatment and timepoint, affirming the robustness of the data. Upon SLB infection, we saw a significant upregulation of various amino acids in addition to several metabolites involved in defense related pathways such as the phenylpropanoid pathway in the resistant lines compared to B73. We will further investigate the corresponding uninoculated comparisons and see if such differences are conserved. Through this approach, our aim is to pinpoint metabolites involved in increased SLB resistance. Given our solid knowledge of the genetic framework for resistance in these lines, by combining our metabolomic quantitative trait locus (mQTL) data for the identified metabolites with SLB resistance QTLs, we aim to identify the genetic and biochemical factors contributing to disease resistance.

## Abstract

Allene oxide cyclases (AOC) convert allene oxide to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA), a required step in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. 12-OPDA and JA represent important signaling molecules that modulate responses to biotic and abiotic stresses while also regulating developmental processes. They are part of a larger group of bioactive oxylipins that can be found in free and lipid-bound forms. We used gene editing to disrupt both copies of AOC in maize. Unexpectedly, AOC double mutants retained the capacity to produce 12-OPDA, accumulating approximately 20% of normal levels. Despite this, double mutants failed to accumulate appreciable levels of jasmonates downstream of 12-OPDA, including jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-isoleucine. Double mutant plants displayed the expected JA deficient phenotypes, including feminization of male florets and extreme susceptibility to insect and necrotrophic fungal pathogens. We have conducted extensive metabolic and gene expression analyses on these mutants, providing a detailed view of the effects of losing JA on defense responses. Strikingly, free oxylipins are severely reduced in double mutants while lipid-bound forms accumulate in response to herbivory. We provide speculation regarding the source of the non-AOC derived 12-OPDA, reasons why the 12-OPDA made by double mutants fails to translate into JA production, and possible explanations for the inversion of the bound vs unbound oxylipin accumulation responses in AOC mutants compared to normal plants.

## Abstract

By extending the growing season of annual crops, we can improve net primaryproductivity and yield, and address the mismatch between soil nitrate availability and cropnitrate demand. In temperate regions, early maize planting requires cold tolerance, a trait notpresent in current elite maize varieties. Tripsacum dactyloides, the closest perennial andcold-tolerant relative of maize, offers a potential source for identifying genes related to coldadaptation. To explore this, we crossed Tripsacum accessions collected from both high- andlow-latitude habitats. The resulting hybrids were screened in a field trial in Ithaca, NY, overtwo years, a location known for its deep freezing winter temperatures. We analyzed proteinexpression levels in the hybrids’ rhizomes and roots, taken during winter (dormant stage) andsummer (active stage), using a shotgun proteomics approach. This analysis was combinedwith RNAseq data from leaf tissues of freezing tolerant seedlings before and after coldacclimation treatments, sampled from F2 families derived from the aforementioned hybrids.Our examination of significant genes, overlapping between the seedling transcriptomic andrhizome proteomics data, identified 109 up-regulated and 161 down-regulated proteinscommon to all three data sets. We compiled a list of cryoprotectants, including thosepreviously known to be involved in abiotic stress, such as late embryogenesis abundant(LEA) proteins, heat shock proteins, and ABA stress ripening genes. Our results presentvariations in copy number, protein structure, and transcription factor binding sites incomparison to orthologs in maize.

## Abstract

Gene editing holds great promise as a significant advance for modern crop plant breeding. To facilitate large scale Agrobacterium transformation mediated gene editing projects in the elite inbred maize cultivar LH244, the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center combined the recently published WOX2A with the BLACKSMITH polycistronic guide RNA expression cassette assembly system to produce MAIZEEDIT binary plasmids. These constructs hold up to four gRNA and feature the Seed RUBY marker gene for non-destructive identification of transgenic and null segregant kernels. In this experiment, nine MAIZEEDIT plasmids were designed, assembled, and transformation and gene editing performance was assessed, for targeting with two guides per gene a total of 17 genes. Molecular and visual analyses were combined to evaluate 162 plants generated from the nine constructs, 130 of which were found to be transgenic via end-point PCR detection of the Seed RUBY marker gene. An amplicon sequencing approach was used to assess gene editing in T0 plants, and gene editing metrics, as well as Seed RUBY performance, are reported. One construct contained gRNA targeting the phytoene synthase gene (y1; also called yellow endosperm 1). Interestingly, some ears which displayed y1 editing, based on visual kernel phenotype, occurred on ears on which Seed RUBY phenotype was not observed. While numerous examples of the expected 3:1 segregation ratio of RUBY:non-RUBY endosperm were observed, consistent with single-locus transgene insertion, multiple instances of unexpected segregation ratios were also found. The frequency of phenotypes observed on ears in which kernel traits were targeted supported that editing occurred early in the transformation process resulting in ears and tassels that were uniformly transmitting edits. Molecular and phenotype analyses of T1 progeny will confirm the operational functionality of the WCIC MAIZEEDIT pipeline to produce, via WOX2A-based transformation combined with polycistronic tRNA delimited gRNA, stable and heritable edited loci.

## Abstract

Plants produce numerous specialized metabolites that function in plant defense, as attractants to pollinators and symbionts, and in cell wall strengthening. Over 50,000 plant terpenoids are known which are synthesized from universal C5 building blocks via the activity of terpene synthases, cytochrome P450s, and glycosyl transferases. A subset of these specialized metabolites are highly valued for a range of properties including insect repellents, fragrances, antimicrobial compounds, low calorie sweeteners, and medicinal properties. It is challenging to economically or sustainably produce many of these compounds from their native species due to the low abundance of the compounds or the time and space required to grow sufficient plants for production of the natural product. In addition, heterologous expression of terpenoid biosynthetic genes in plants is problematic due to the tendency for conversion of the activated products into conjugates or other derivatives via endogenous cytochrome P450s, and glycosyl transferases. In this project, we are using gene editing and transformation technologies to overcome these challenges by creating a novel tomato chassis with minimal fruit terpenoid biosynthetic capacity through removal of native terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, that will enable engineering of high value terpenoid molecules in tomato fruit.

## Abstract

The extensive use of nitrogen (N) in maize agriculture is a major contributor to environmental challenges, including waterway N pollution and N2O emissions. Enhancing maize N use-efficiency and recycling can contribute to mitigate these environmental impacts. Perennial grasses, including maize relatives of the Andropogoneae tribe, have evolved efficient N recycling strategies, making them a valuable genetic reservoir to improve N management in maize. One of these N-recycling strategies is the remobilization of N from aboveground to underground tissues that perennial grasses activate post-flowering and during the winter. This study aims to engineer perennial-like root N remobilization in maize after grain filling to reduce N leaching and N2O emissions. Our approach involves identifying key genes for perennial N-remobilization through seasonal tracking of N, amino acid and gene expression profiles in both roots and leaves of multiple Andropogoneae species grown under field conditions. We will also conduct a detailed analysis of gene expression and total N profiles in B73 maize with Zea diploperennis introgressions. This analysis will span from the flowering stage to senescence, under field conditions. Additionally, we will compare these profiles in plants with and without a developing ear (sink) to pinpoint key genes responsible for root N remobilization in the absence of an N sink after flowering. Following the identification of key genes, we will employ comparative evolutionary genomics within the Andropogoneae tribe to further refine our selection of candidate genes for root N remobilization. These genes will subsequently be introduced into maize using genetic engineering or introgression techniques. This study aims to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and N leaching, paving the way for more sustainable maize agriculture practices.

## Abstract

Drought stress, a major threat to global food security, is intensifying due to climate change. Among cereal crops, sorghum stands out for its remarkable drought resilience, demonstrating superior adaptability to water scarcity compared to other major cereals. Under drought stress, sorghum exhibits a multifaceted response. Leaf rolling and stomata closure reduce transpiration, while photosynthetic efficiency adapts for optimal water use. Reduced growth prioritizes resources, and root architecture adjusts for enhanced water uptake, ensuring survival in harsh conditions. Here, we explore the genetic foundations of sorghum drought resilience through whole-plant phenotyping of a sequence-indexed, EMS mutagenized sorghum population using an automated, high-throughput field scanner system in Maricopa, AZ. This allowed us to identify mutants displaying various responses to drought stress, including those with altered photosynthetic efficiencies and exaggerated leaf rolling. Among these, the leaf rolling 1 (lr1) mutant exhibited a severe leaf rolling phenotype even in response to mild environmental stress. Characterization of this mutant also revealed a defective root system. Analysis of an F2 mapping population indicated that both traits were recessive. We performed bulked segregant analysis using DNA pools from individuals with either the leaf rolling or defective root phenotypes and showed that a single locus on chromosome 9 was responsible for both traits. Further characterization of the lr1 mutant through 3D reconstruction of root development, controlled stress experiments, and gene editing will provide mechanistic insights into root-to-shoot responses to drought stress. Overall, our field-based analyses of mutant phenotypes allow us to link genotype to stress-responsive phenotype, unraveling the genetic intricacies of sorghum's drought resilience and paving the way for the development of drought-resistant varieties crucial for ensuring food security in a changing climate.

## Abstract

With the world’s climate becoming more extreme it has imposed great challenges on agriculture and food security. Maize is a staple crop that much of the world depends on and it is vital to ensure it can overcome these stressors and flourish under these harsher growing conditions. The main method in getting corn to adapt to these new stressors is to create better varieties with better attributes to overcome these stresses. A key component in making this possible is to make the highly genetically diverse tropical corn lines available to breeding programs and maize geneticists around the world and not have it limited to the tropics due to photoperiod sensitivity. The three main genes suspected to suppress flowering of tropical corn in long day (temperate) latitudes are ZmRAP2.7, ZmCCT9, and ZmCCT10. In our lab the process to screen for different combinations of functional or edited alleles of these genes is very slow and tedious. It requires many steps, physical labor, and processes a very low number of samples at a time. On average for one person to prepare DNA from 20 leaf samples with our current protocol takes 3 to 4 hours. My goal is to create a DNA extraction protocol for maize that is affordable, fast, high throughput, and produces high quality DNA ready for PCR so that the plants can be screened more quickly and This would help other labs working with maize or similar DNA because they would be able to extract DNA faster and more efficiently.

## Abstract

Few agricultural soils provide sufficient nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) to maximize the yields of modern corn hybrids. Consequently, nearly 7 million tons of N and 2 million tons of P are applied to US soils annually for corn production, at a combined farm price in excess of $5 billion. Reducing fertilizer inputs offers immediate economic and environmental benefits and will contribute to more sustainable cropping systems. Despite recent progress from Arabidopsis and rice that increases our understanding of N and P signaling, detailed functional information on these processes in maize is lacking. Prior work from our groups using genetic mapping, plant physiology, and gene expression profiling approaches supports the hypothesis that interactions among specific members of the NITRATE TRANSPORTER1.1 (Nrt1.1), PHO1, and SPX protein families mediate coordinated responses to fluctuations in N and P supply. A collection of variant alleles for these three gene families has been obtained from natural diversity, transposon mutagenesis, and targeted CRISPR/Cas9 editing. We share an update of our phenotypic analyses of single and combined genetic variants. Three important findings to date include: 1) mutations in different NRT1.1 paralogs vary for their impact on N uptake and growth responses to N; 2) a nrt1.1 mutant suppresses enhanced responses to P of a pho1;2a mutant; and 3) analyses of patterns of genetic diversity suggest variants with reduced sensitivity to N and P supply are associated with recent breeding improvements in nutrient utilization among U.S. Corn Belt maize hybrids.

## Abstract

Grass species, which include the major cereal crops maize, wheat, rice, and sugarcane, are an integral part of our global agriculture and source of food and energy for a growing world population. GRASSIUS was established as a knowledge base for transcription factors (TFs) and coregulators (CRs) in maize and several other species in the grass family. TFs are a primary component of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and the underlying gene regulatory grids (GRGs) that govern all aspects of plant growth and metabolism. GRASSIUS is the source for all information pertaining to the maize TFome collection, which serves as a powerful resource for the discovery of GRNs in corn and other cereals (Burdo et al., Plant J, 2014 80: 356-66, Yang et al., 2017. Mol Plant, 10:498–515). Here we announce the release of the GRASSIUS 2.0 knowledgebase (www.grassius.org) with updated data, query, and tool features, as well as the ability to expand to accommodate future datasets. The membership and annotation of all TF and CR families has been updated and revised to include gene models from versions 3, 4, and 5, of the maize genome. A translation tool enables cross referencing of Gene IDs between versions of the maize genome. A new Protein-DNA Interaction (PDI) Collection has been added that incorporates PDIs derived from ChIP, ChIP-seq, DAP-seq, pChIP, and Y1H datasets. A filtering tools permits the selection of PDIs within a ± 2kb distance from the transcriptional start site of a gene of interest. A new BLAST tool facilitates searching of the maize TFome as well as v3, v4, and v5 TF gene model sets. Lastly, we describe the methodology used to implement GRASSIUS 2.0 which can guide others in developing and updating similar plant gene regulatory knowledgebases. This project was funded by NSF grant IOS-1733633.

## Abstract

The efficient production of hybrid seed remains a key cost of goods challenge in corn, due to the need for sterilization of the male. For decades, manual and mechanical detasseling has been used to eliminate unwanted pollen in hybrid production fields, complemented by the more recent implementation of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), and other proprietary hybridization systems. Looking for novel gene targets to create genic male sterility, we returned to a pair of classic maize mutants colorless2 (C2) and whitepollen1 (WHP1). In the homozygous double mutant, mutations in these two genes are reported to result in a flavonol-complementable-male sterility. Within the maize flavonol biosynthetic pathway, we identified a similar pair of male-expressed genes, with predicted chalcone synthase activity, chalcone synthase2 (CHLS2) and chalcone synthase11 (CHLS11). We created null mutants for these two genes using CRISPR-Cas12 technology and confirmed editing with Taqman and sanger sequencing. Interestingly, and contrary to the stable male sterility observed in c2 whp1 double mutants, these edited lines demonstrated a conditional male sterility phenotype in the homozygous double mutant.

## Abstract

Maize above-ground architecture, primarily affected by plant height and leaf architecture, is regulated by phytohormones including brassinosteroids (BR), gibberellins (GA), and auxins. Architectural mutants with defects in the biosynthesis or signaling of these hormones identify components of these pathways and enhance our knowledge about plant growth and development. We characterized three mutant alleles of gras42, the maize ortholog of rice DWARF AND LOW TILLERING (DLT) gene. The gras42 mutants have semi-dwarf stature, shorter and wider leaves, and more upright leaf angles, and resemble the expected phenotype for a weak loss of BR signaling. In rice, DLT is a positive regulator of BR signaling. In Arabidopsis, this gene plays a role in cell cycle-regulated gene expression. An RNA-seq analysis of the expression consequences in the maize gras42-mu1021149 loss-of-function mutant matched a weak loss of BR signaling, consistent with its previously demonstrated role in BR signaling in rice. This was demonstrated using a parametric index calculated from the expression of experimentally determined BR-responsive genes. A coordinated increase in the transcript levels of BR-repressed genes and decrease in the transcripts of BR-induced genes was observed in the gras42 loss-of-function mutant. The double mutant phenotypes of gras42-mu1021149 with na1-1 and d1 also indicated that gras42 encodes a positive regulator of BR-responsive gene expression. Like other BR deficiencies, gras42-mu1021149 effects on tassel development were suppressed by loss of GA in the d1 mutant and suppressed the promotion of tiller growth by loss of GA. In single-cell transcriptomic data, GRAS42 expression was found in cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, including nascent stomatal complexes, suggesting a conserved role for gras42 in cell cycle gene expression between maize and Arabidopsis. In addition, a GWAS of natural variation in GRAS42 expression identified known BR pathway genes as regulators of gras42 expression.

## Abstract

Stalk lodging severely limits crop yield and causes global annual losses of at least 6 billion USD in Maize (Zea mays L.). The genetic architecture of stalk lodging resistance remains poorly resolved due to 1) a poor understanding of phenotypes contributing to stalk strength and 2) lack of standardized phenotyping approaches to record these intermediate phenotypes. We generated a high-resolution phenome of maize stalks on 40 geometric, structural, and biomechanical phenotypes in a diversity panel, examined the impact of these traits on stalk lodging resistance, and identified underlying loci. Preserving the field location and identity of individual plants revealed substantial intra-plot variation indicating the effect of micro-environment on the phenotypic continuum of the intermediate phenotypes. The single-plant data allowed us to account for spatial effects and increase the accuracy of phenotype data for genetic analyses. Genetic correlations revealed a stronger association of intermediate phenotypes measured on the lower-most elongated internode with stalk flexural stiffness as compared to those measured on the primary ear-bearing internode. Most of the phenotypes under study exhibited low to moderate heritability indicating low genetic tractability and complex genetic inheritance. Multi-trait genome wide association analyses of combinations of different biomechanical, structural, and geometric phenotypes showed candidate genes involved in plant and ear height development, electron transport, membrane structure and transport, oxidoreductase activity, transcription factors, etc. Interestingly, majority of the SNPs identified are associated with the non-coding regions of the genome and certain SNPs are shared between different trait combinations indicating pleiotropic regulation of stalk lodging resistance. Characterizing novel candidate genes and regulatory variation identified in the present study would open avenues for disentangling the genetic architecture of stalk lodging resistance in maize.

## Abstract

The formation of the plant body proceeds post-embryonically through the coordinated action of small groups of stem cells called meristems. Maintenance of meristems is mediated by the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL negative feedback loop. Aberrations in this well-conserved pathway result in either enlarged or prematurely terminated meristems. As such, in maize, grain yield is ultimately determined by the size of the female inflorescence meristem (IM) which dictates the number of rows of kernels in an ear of corn. Prior characterization of ramosa1 enhancer locus2 (rel2) mutants revealed pleiotropic vegetative and reproductive phenotypes such as defective axillary meristem initiation and IM maintenance in single recessive mutants. The REL2 family of transcriptional corepressor proteins is composed of four members, REL2, REL2-LIKE1 (RELK1), RELK2 and RELK3. Interestingly, rel2;relk1 mutants display enhanced enlargement in female IMs. However, it is currently unclear whether REL2-RELK1 function in the canonical CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway or in parallel pathways. To distinguish these possibilities, we performed a genetic interaction analysis with rel2 and known meristem maintenance mutants: thick tassel dwaf1 (td1), fasciated ear3 (fea3), and fasciated ear4 (fea4). TD1 encodes an LRR-receptor-like kinase, FEA3 encodes an LRR-receptor-like protein while FEA4 encodes a bZIP transcription factor. Our analysis showed a strong synergistic interaction between rel2 and fea3, and rel2 and fea4, while an epistatic interaction was detected between rel2 and td1 mutants. These results suggest that REL2, FEA3, and FEA4, work in parallel pathways regulating meristem size, while TD1 and REL2 may work in the same pathway. As the signaling cascades initiated by TD1 and FEA3 ultimately repress the expression of the stem-cell promoting transcription factor WUS1, we are currently analyzing the genetic interactions between rel2, relk1, and wus1 mutants. We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (IOS#2026561).

## Abstract

The cuticle is a hydrophobic barrier that covers all surfaces of the aerial organs of land plants. It provides the first line of defense from biotic and abiotic stresses that negatively impact plant health. The cuticle is composed of solvent-extractable cuticular waxes that are both intercalated within and laid atop an insoluble cutin polyester matrix. Cuticular wax composition varies depending on organ and stage of development, but usually consists of combinations of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and wax esters. Classical genetic strategies have identified numerous glossy genes required for normal cuticle deposition in maize, and molecular characterization of these genes provides insights on cuticle formation. This study focuses on the maize Glossy2 (Gl2) gene. Although the biochemical function of GL2 remains unclear, homozygous gl2 mutant seedlings exhibit a glossy phenotype and the cuticular waxes of mutant plants are of shorter chain lengths, presumably due to an alteration of the fatty acid elongase complex (FAE). The Recently identified GL2-paralog, GLOSSY2-LIKE, shares 63% amino acid similarity with GL2. To assess the in planta function of Gl2-like, six mutant alleles were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Cuticle analyses of single gl2 and gl2-like mutants, and gl2;gl2-like double mutants demonstrate both overlapping and distinct contributions to FAE across different tissue types. While cuticular wax composition on maize leaves is primarily affected by the gl2 mutation, a chemotype was only observed on maize silks in the gl2;gl2-like double mutant. The functionality of GL2 and GL2-LIKE proteins has also been investigated via a synthetic biology approach in yeast, in which each paralog was co-expressed in an assortment of strains that also expressed enzymes from the maize FAE system. This combination of multidisciplinary strategies is unraveling the roles that Gl2 and Gl2-like serve in maize cuticle biosynthesis.

## Abstract

The application of high-throughput sequencing to transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) has enabled significant advances in our understanding of gene expression in plants. The most widely adopted RNA-Seq protocol involves the purification of total cellular RNA, followed by reverse transcription and sequencing. Conventional RNA-Seq suffers some limitations. It reflects the balance between synthesis and degradation of each transcript (“steady-state”) and not its transcription rate in the nucleus. It also lacks the sensitivity to detect unstable and low-abundance RNA species, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To get a better estimate of transcriptional activity, we used the cell-permeable uracil analog, 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) to label nascent RNA of maize B73 root tips in vivo . After ribosomal RNA depletion, the EU-labeled RNA was sequenced, together with the steady-state nuclear RNA and steady-state cellular RNA. The nascent and steady-state cellular RNA profiles were clearly distinct, while the nascent and steady-state nuclear RNA profiles were tightly correlated. About 60% of the expressed genes were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value

## Abstract

Improved genetics and agronomic practices have augmented maize productivity to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population. However, the process of selective breeding applied to increase productivity has resulted in the unintended selection of crop varieties lacking important compounds, such as many phenolics including flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, which play important roles in plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses and are also beneficial for the human and animal diet, when accumulating in the seed. As a result, this can lead to significant productivity losses under stress conditions. Consequently, there is a growing interest in better understanding the biosynthesis and regulation of phenolic compounds in maize. The objective of this study is to determine genes leading to the formation and regulation of phenolic compounds in maize by conducting two different strategies: (1) Homology-base identification. We utilized the repertoire of well-characterized Arabidopsis phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism genes to identify candidate orthologs (homology >90%) in the maize B73 (v4) genome. The protein sequences of these orthologues were used to search the maize genome for similar proteins using BLASTP and a total of 249 gene models from 28 gene families were identified. Then we used available genome-wide expression analysis to determine which family members are predominantly expressed and explored their co-expression with other pathway genes to establish which isoform might participate in the biosynthesis of the various pathway products. (2) A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for a set of 33 phenolic compounds profiled across 597 genetically diverse inbred lines, grown under controlled conditions. Three biological replicates were used, and seedling stem samples were collected for analysis. Phenolic compounds were quantified using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a rapid separation targeted method. Our initial results revealed several candidate genes belonging to various families, including UDP glycosyltransferases, acyl-CoA synthetases, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, and methyltransferases, which are potentially involved in the formation of various phenolic compounds. Additionally, new members of the MYB and BHLH transcription factor families, previously reported to regulate the production of flavonoids, production were identified. A subset of these candidate genes is currently being experimentally validated by monitoring metabolic changes of phenolic compounds in maize protoplasts transformed with the respective genes in various maize genotypes. The outcomes of this study will provide a valuable resource for improved plant breeding for stress tolerance and overall maize improvement.

## Abstract

Mutants with defects in pathways can help expose regulation. But strong phenotypically impactful mutations do not always detect the same changes in expression affected by the natural variants that fine tune pathway functions and determine fitness. This is especially true for essential genes and genes in highly conserved pathways. Tetrapyrroles are macrocyclic compounds present in and required for all life on earth. In plants, they include chlorophyll, heme, siroheme, and phytochromobilin and are required for photosynthesis, respiration, metabolism, and light perception. All tetrapyrroles in plants are synthesized from a common phototoxic precursor, Uroporphyrinogen III. Competition among the necessary branches for shared substrates and the presence of multiple phototoxic intermediates and side products suggest that regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis should be tight and complex. Maintaining a balance between the branches to serve the demands of photosynthesis, respiration, and metabolism while avoiding photodamage must be a critical function of this regulation. We used RNA-seq to study the impact of a semi-dominant dominant-negative complex-poisoning allele of Mg chelatase subunit I, Oil yellow1-N1989, on transcription in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Coordinate and compensatory effects were observed at multiple genes encoding steps in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis demonstrating heretofore unknown transcriptional regulation of this pathway. Expression level GWA analysis of tetrapyrrole pathway genes revealed that natural variation at the oy1 locus also affected coordinate transcriptional regulation of multiple genes encoding steps in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in wildtype plants. This transcriptional feedback in the absence of strong phenotypic impacts demonstrates that detected regulation works under physiologically relevant perturbations of chlorophyll biosynthesis. We identified a subset of genes in tetrapyrrole pathway as the common targets of transcription regulation and identified multiple trans-regulatory hotspots affecting the coordinate regulation of this pathway.

## Abstract

With the human population increasing, it is essential to find novel ways to increase sustainable food production. Maize is a globally important staple crop, but due to flowering time issues, we are not able to fully utilize the extensive genetic diversity of tropical maize for crop improvement. Tropical maize has the potential to contribute desirable traits such as pest/disease resistance, stalk stability, and drought tolerance to temperate breeding efforts, but its late flowering in temperate environments limits its use. Plant biotechnology strategies can be used to address this issue, but first we need to more fully understand the molecular genetic network controlling maize flowering time. My project aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of the maize flowering time promoter, ZmEhd1. ZmEhd1 is a homolog of the rice Ehd1 flowering activator and encodes a B-type response regulator, similar to transcriptional activators of the cytokinin signaling pathway. I am using a maize protoplast system to (i) confirm the correct ZmEhd1 gene structure using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (ii) determine if ZmEhd1 localizes to the nucleus, (iii) use deletions to map the ZmEhd1 nuclear localization domain, and (iv) use transcriptomics to determine how overexpressing ZmEhd1 impacts other parts of the flowering time network. Understanding the functional determinants of ZmEhd1 will provide a more complete picture of its role in the maize flowering time network. This new information can help inform novel biotechnological approaches to amend the flowering issues in tropical maize, allowing its broader use in maize breeding programs worldwide, thus, helping to improve sustainable food production.

## Abstract

Commercial production of transgenic maize relies on agrobacterium-mediated transformation due to the simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and stable inheritance of exogenous genes with low copy numbers. However, transformability and rengenerability remain a bottleneck in tropical maize lines, where limited genotypes and lower transformation efficiencies persist. Recent advances in morphogenic regulators (e.g. BBM and WUS2) which enhance somatic embryo formation have expanded the range of transformable genotypes, particularly in temperate maize lines. To address the challenges in tropical maize transformation, our study aimed to enhance the process using calcium channel blockers (CCB) in conjunction with morphogenic regulators. CCBs are pharmacological agents that can hinder the plant's immune response by specifically targeting calcium signaling pathways, affecting hypersensitive response. Here, we investigate the impact of Ca2+ chelators (EDTA and EGTA) and a non-selective calcium channel antagonist, (lanthanum chloride), on the transformability and regeneration frequency of tropical inbred lines, Tzi8 and CML277, using varying concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mM). We pre-treated immature embryos of Tzi8 and CML277 with calcium channel blockers before transformation with an auxotrophic agrobacterium LBA4404Thy-containing pHP81430, a heat shock excisable BBM and WUS2 vector with a modified acetolactase synthase gene as a selectable marker. Endpoint PCR was used to identify T0 plants and screen for BBM and WUS2. ddPCR was used to determine copy number variation of the T0 plants. The highest regeneration percentages (2.6%) and occurrence of single copy events (3.3%) were achieved in Tzi8 when immature embryos were pre-treated with 10 mM LaCl3. In CML 277, regeneration percentages were highest in immature zygotic embryos pre-treated with 1 mM EDTA (86%), and occurrences of single copy events were at 2.7%. No T0 plants were produced in the no pre-treatment controls for both inbreds. This study successfully improved the transformation and regeneration efficiency of the two tropical inbreds using CCBs.

## Abstract

Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) are frequently utilized in agricultural settings as bioinoculants due to their positive impact on plant growth. BiomaPhos® stands out as the first Brazilian commercial bioinoculant, featuring a consortium of two P-solubilizing Bacillus strains (CNPMS B2084 and CNPMS B119). Our objective was to assess the influence of BiomaPhos® inoculation and phosphate fertilization on the microbial communities within the maize rhizosphere. Field experiments were conducted at the Embrapa Maize and Sorghum Experimental Station in Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, using clayey soil (Oxisol) during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons. The maize genotype DKB390 underwent inoculation with and without BiomaPhos® and was subjected to three P-fertilizer treatments: no P-fertilizer addition (P0), Rock phosphate (RockP), or triple superphosphate (TSP) at a rate of 120 kg of P2O5 ha-1. Genetic diversity was evaluated during flowering time through T-RFLP, and taxonomic groups were identified using MiCA3 software. In the 2019/2020 harvest, no significant differences in bacterial diversity were observed among treatments. However, in 2020/2021, notable distinctions in bacterial communities emerged between the rhizosphere soil of inoculated and non-inoculated maize crops cultivated with 120 kg.ha-1 of TSP and P0. The predominant bacterial families in the first and second seasons were Streptomycetaceae (34.6% and 40.4%), Micrococcaceae (15.14% and 12.0%), and Methylobacteriaceae (10.9% and 13.7%), respectively. Additionally, there was a noteworthy increase in the abundance of the Rhizobiaceae, Sphingnomonadaceae, and Brucellaceae families, coupled with a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae, Geobacteraceae, Micrococcaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae in the second season. The comprehension the impact of inoculation should be further investigated. Further exploration is needed to understand the implications of inoculation.

## Abstract

Phytopathogenic fungi are some of the most damaging plant pathogens. In maize, ears can be colonized and infected with the fungus Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Gibberella ear rot (GER). Infected grain contains mycotoxins that causes severe health risks to humans and livestock when consumed. Host resistance is an important management strategy for GER. In 2021 and 2022 we screened a diverse panel of maize lines (n= 318) for resistance and identified markers associated with GER resistance and toxin accumulation. We then selected and screened near-isogenic lines based on our findings and the literature regarding GER resistance. The selected near-isogenic lines are either in a B73 background with introgressions from teosinte (n= 25) or Oh43 (n= 72), or in an H100 background with introgressions from NC344 (n= 202). We evaluated these lines for resistance to GER in 2023 in Urbana, IL. In the B73 × Oh43, B73 × teosinte, and NC344 × H100 populations most lines were moderately resistant with a slight skew towards susceptibility. We identified multiple lines that were significantly different (α = 0.05) from their recurrent parent based on a Dunnett's post hoc test. A total of 6 and 3 lines were significantly more susceptible than B73 in the B73 × Oh43 and B73 × teosinte populations, respectively. In the NC344 × H100 population, 14 lines were significantly more resistant than NC344. We then identified regions associated with susceptibility and resistance. We plan to evaluate the selected near-isogenic lines again in 2024 to validate our findings. We believe that these lines will be useful for exploring the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to GER.

## Abstract

Cereal Grains are a poor source of essential amino acids (EAA). A diet that lacks a sufficient quantity of EAAs contributes to malnutrition and growth deficiencies. As most amino acids in the seed are constituents of proteins, targeting protein-bound amino acid (PBAA) for nutritional enhancement is the most plausible method. However, previous studies have attempted to overexpress or knockout proteins to increase EAAs contents, but it was largely unsuccessful. This is because PBAA regulation is a complex trait that is tightly controlled by the interactions of multiple networks in the cell. The tight maintenance of PBAA composition and proteome reprogramming in mutants of seed storage proteins is shared across multiple organisms. However, we know very little about the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of PBAA in the seed. To better understand the genetic and metabolic basis of PBAA robustness and regulation in the seed, we have utilized a combination of mutant approaches and multi-omics by performing differential proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on seed storage protein mutants and compared them to unperturbed genotypes. Overlap of TWAS and differential proteomics identify 101 high-confidence candidate genes mostly involved in protein metabolism. From the overlap, we saw a significant enrichment of translational components. Changes in protein abundance and gene expression show heterogeneous expression of translational components across development across tissue types and between genotypes. Phosphoproteomics results show that change in phosphorylation is independent of change in protein abundance. Phospho-peptide enrichment at 26DAP shows an overall increase in the phosphorylation of translation initiation and mRNA binding, while there is a decrease in phosphorylation of mRNA metabolic processes. These results indicate a potential role for the translational machinery in maintaining/regulating protein content and amino acid composition in the seed. Further analyses of translational-component mutants will provide more insight into the changes in PBAA and FAA across seed development. Understanding the tight regulation of PBAA will enable us to find new strategies to push forward amino acid biofortification efforts.

## Abstract

Inv4m is a chromosomal inversion commonly found in traditional maize varieties grown in the Mexican highlands. Inv4m was introgressed into cultivated maize from highland teosinte mexicana, and its highland predominance points to its contribution to local adaptation. In a Mexican diversity panel, Inv4m shows a classical pattern of gene-by-environment interaction produced by local adaptation: plants with the Inv4m-highland allele have delayed flowering in lowland fields and earlier flowering in highland fields. In growth chamber experiments, Inv4m-highland has been shown to regulate the expression of photosynthesis genes in response to cold. In addition to cold, phosphorus is a limiting factor for plant growth in the Mexican highlands. In these conditions, Inv4m might increase highland fitness by carrying beneficial alleles of phos2 a locus involved in phosphorus starvation response (PSR). In this study, we test whether Inv4m-highland contributes to local adaptation through an enhanced response to phosphorus deficiency. First, we bred Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) in B73 containing Inv4m-highland introgressed from MICH21, a traditional Mexican maize variety, for isolating the effect of Inv4m-highland in a single genetic background. Then we grew the Inv4m-highland and control lines in the field under phosphorus sufficiency and deficiency. We measured flowering time, morphological traits, and leaf gene expression with RNA-seq. We found that independent of soil phosphorus status, Inv4m-highland NILs flowered faster and grew taller than the controls while maintaining grain yield. There was a genomewide transcriptomic response to available phosphorus, affecting 10978 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with the largest effect shown by PILNCR1-miR399, a PSR regulator. The effect of Inv4m-highland is narrower, affecting 619 DEGs, mainly within the boundaries of the inversion. The Inv4m perturbation of PSR is limited to 157 DEGs. Our results confirm the contribution of Inv4m to adaptation, as faster flowering, but we don’t find evidence of its dependency on PSR.

## Abstract

After domestication, maize adapted to very different environmental conditions across the world. The molecular basis of how maize was able to adapt is not fully understood. Our lab has recently reported that variation in phosphatidylcholine levels in Zea mays helped maize adapt to different elevations. Variation in phospholipid levels from maize varieties adapted to different elevations is largely attributed to High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1), which encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme (Barnes, Rodríguez-Zapata, Juárez-Nuñez et al. 2021). Palomero Toluqueño (PT), a highland traditional variety from central Mexico, and other highland varieties including the highland teosinte mexicana carry an impaired hpc1 function. The highland allele has also been found in maize adapted to colder environments, like Canada and Northern Europe. Maize lines carrying the highland hpc1 allele have shorter flowering times and better fitness when grown in highland conditions when compared to lowland maize. However, the molecular mechanisms of hpc1 impaired function are still unclear. On one hand, a mutation in the flap lid domain of hpc1 in highland maize may impair phosphatidylcholine access to the enzyme's active site. On the other hand expression data and promoter sequence analysis suggest that variation in hpc1 expression levels may also play a role in determining the metabolic output of hpc1 genetic variation. To investigate different genetic elements and enzymatic activity between HPC1-PT and HPC1-B73, we have cloned and expressed HPC1 in yeast. Using this heterologous system, together with targeted mutagenesis and lipase domain swapping between the two hpc1 alleles we hope to identify the possible causative mutations affecting HPC1 activity. Additionally, we are performing promoter swapping between the B73 and PT alleles of hpc1 to explore the possible effect of regulatory variants on hpc1 expression and the possible interaction between hpc1 gene expression and HPC1 enzyme activity.

## Abstract

Plants rely on cell-mediated innate immunity and systemic signals from infected sites to activate defense responses against pathogens. The plant's local response to infection induces the production of signaling compounds such as salicylic acid that will further lead to the systemic expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in a phenomenon called systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Consequently, the systemic acquired resistance response results in enhanced broad-spectrum immunity of distantly located tissues. Although research on SAR in monocotyledonous systems has increased over the years, most of the research has been conducted on dicotyledonous plants. Maize is an important staple food worldwide and it can be highly affected by diseases causing yield losses and reduced food availability, thus affecting food security. This study aims to investigate the maize SAR response to the southern leaf blight (SLB) pathogen, Cochliobolus heterostrophus, which is found in maize cultivation all around the world. In our preliminary experiments, a series of 3-week-old B73 maize plants showed that a localized inoculation with Cochliobolus heterostrophus at different time points (time 0, 24, and 48 hours) in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th leaves resulted in less disease severity in the upper leaves of inoculated plants when compared to the non-inoculated plants 72 hours post-inoculation. Further analysis on different maize lines will be conducted to confirm that Cochliobolus heterostrophus induces the SAR response and how it differs between lines.

## Abstract

Plants contain a multitude of cell types, yet all these cells arise from the same DNA. Correct spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is crucial for the production of specialized cell types. This spatiotemporal gene expression is mediated by DNA sequences known as cis-regulatory elements (CREs). CREs, often present in clusters, recruit transcription factors (TFs) to activate or repress local gene expression. In this way, CRE clusters can be classified into two broad categories: enhancers and silencers. Enhancers increase the expression of nearby genes irrespective of the orientation, direction, and distance. Conversely, silencers reduce the expression of the target genes. Some silencer CREs recruit the Polycomb Repressive Complex2, which deposits the transcriptionally repressive histone modification H3K27me3 at nearby sequences. Teosinte branched 1 (Tb1) is one of the major domestication QTL controlling branching in maize. Tb1 is responsible for suppression of axillary bud outgrowth on the main stem and development of female inflorescence in maize. Tb1 expression is controlled by a H3K27me3 regulated distal control region. This Tb1 regulatory region exhibits tissue-dynamic chromatin accessibility and H3K27me3 levels that correspond to Tb1 activation, making it a good model to study how plant CREs regulate histone modifications to control gene expression. This study dissects the roles of the TB1 distal regulatory region by using CRISPR-CAS9 to systematically delete the underlying CREs and determine their roles in controlling TB1 expression. Preliminary phenotypic results showed that Tb1 deletion and specific CRE deletion events produced morphological effects such as tillering and masculinization of the maize ear. Extensive Phenotyping of all the deletion lines is currently being performed as well as understanding how distinct CREs within the Tb1 QTL interact with one another.

## Abstract

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that modulate protein abundance will allow breeders to use modern gene editing and standard breeding techniques effectively for generating more resilient and productive varieties for the challenging environments to come with the new global climate. One such mechanism is protein abundance regulation by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). uORFs are prevalent among eukaryotes. Their start and stop codons appear to be evolutionarily more conserved than expected by neutral evolution suggesting that their repressive activity is important for adequate translation. Evidence for this is seen when mutations that modify existing uORFs or create new ones are known to cause diseases in humans. In plants, uORFs have been found to affect phosphorus content in leaves, petal color, and grain dimension for example. In fruit fly, regardless of the rate of transcription, uORFs show varying patterns of ribosome occupancy across tissues for each transcript. This suggests that uORFs are translated in a tissue-specific manner. We gathered ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing data from 44 samples in maize (22 tissues and 2 biological replicates) to determine if uORFs are also translated in a tissue-specific manner. We identified 131,177 candidate uORFs with canonical start (i.e., AUG) and stop (UAA, UAG, and UGA) codons. We calculated the expression as transcript per million (TPM) for the uORFs and the mORFs (i.e., coding sequences) for each transcript. We find, as in fruit fly, that uORFs have different translation rates among different tissues. We have calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of the rate of ribosome occupancy in the uORFs versus that in the mORFs. We are using this relationship to identify uORFs that are repressing translation and to investigate patterns of global protein abundance regulation.

## Abstract

Chromatin accessibility to diffusible nucleases such as DNase I and MNase has long been accepted as a feature of open chromatin regions in eukaryotic genomes. These open chromatin regions are generally transcriptionally active, enriched in gene-regulatory sequences, and revealed using these nucleases under partial digest conditions, which serve to preferentially release DNA fragments for analysis. These nuclease hypersensitivity-defined sites frequently contain specific DNA sequences known as cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs), including transcription factor (TF) binding sites. The properties of MNase allow for high-resolution mapping of chromatin particles which mostly consist of two components, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and its cognate CRE. Therefore, analysis of small fragments of DNA recovered from partial or light chromatin digests enables single-assay genome-wide identification of nuclease-protected footprints of hundreds of TFs within accessible chromatin regions. These footprints represent a transcriptional regulatory atlas of TF-occupied sites, collectively referred to as a cistrome occupancy map. Cistrome occupancy can vary across cell or tissue types in a given eukaryotic genome, as well as across various stress states. By comparing cistrome occupancy across physiological states, one can identify candidate CREs for control of transcriptional responses to environmental or developmental cues. This study applies our established MNase-defined cistrome-Occupancy Analysis (MOA-seq) to a set of flood-treated maize seedlings with variation in a previously characterized flood-tolerance phenotype. Two resistant (Oh7b and Ky21) and one sensitive (B73) inbred maize lines, along with the closely-related grass, Sorghum bicolor (BTx623), were subjected as young seedlings to 24 hours of total underwater submergence. For each genotype, MOA-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed hundreds of genes that underwent significant changes in transcript abundance and identified several thousand loci that exhibited changes in small particle occupancy. Together, these analyses reveal atlases of cis-elements implicated in genomic response to submergence underlying variation in an abiotic stress tolerance phenotype.

## Abstract

Genetic transformation is a process by which novel DNA and or proteins are introduced into crops and has been an essential tool for improving crop performance via genetic engineering and genome editing. One of the biggest challenges of maize transformation is identifying an inbred that is commercially relevant and transformable. Over the past 20 years, several studies have identified nuclear loci that are associated with transformability in maize, but these factors are generally unable to impart transformable broadly across germplasm. One unexplored area contributing to maize transformation is mitochondrial genotype. There are five cytoplasm genotypes in maize characterized by both differences in sequence and their impact on pollen production in combination with nuclear encoded genes. The two “normal” cytotypes (normal A and normal B) have no know impact on any biological process while cms-C, cms-S and cms-T contain unique mitochondrial open reading frames that require nuclear encoded gene products to overcome their impacts (Allen et al. 2007). Here, approximately 100 maize inbred lines were screened for cytoplasm genotype, and six Normal A cytotype inbreds were confirmed to be transformable. These studies demonstrating that a fast and simple screening for cytoplasm genotype has the potential to advance crop engineering by using superior corn germplasm for transformation.

## Abstract

Plant-derived volatiles are important mediators of plant-insect interactions as they can provide cues for host location and quality, or act as direct or indirect defense molecules. The volatiles produced by Zea mays (maize) include a range of terpenes, likely produced by several of the terpene synthases (TPS) present in maize. Determining the roles of specific terpene volatiles and individual TPSs in maize-insect interactions is challenging due to the promiscuous nature of TPSs in vitro and their potential for functional redundancy. In this study, we used metabolite GWAS of a sweetcorn diversity panel infested with Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) to identify genetic correlations between TPSs and individual volatiles. This analysis revealed a correlation between maize terpene synthase 1 (ZmTPS1) and emission of the monoterpene volatiles linalool and β-myrcene. Quantification of headspace volatiles in a maize tps1 loss-of-function mutant confirmed that ZmTPS1 is an important contributor to linalool and β-myrcene emission in maize. Furthermore, pairwise choice assays between tps1 mutant and wild-type plants showed that ZmTPS1, and by extension its volatile products, aid host location in the chewing insect S. frugiperda, yet repel the sap-sucking pest, Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid). ZmTPS1 is therefore an important mediator of the interactions between maize and its insect pests.

## Abstract

Anthracnose Leaf Blight (ALB) and Stalk Rot, caused by a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum graminicola, results in maize annual losses of up to $1 billion in the United States. Additionally, the necrotroph Cochliobolus heterostrophus causes Southern Corn Leaf Blight (SCLB) disease, which devastated 15% of US and southern Canada maize crops during the 1970 epidemics, and results in substantial yield loss to this day. To improve resistance to these pathogens, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of defense and new genetic targets for molecular breeding are needed. Fatty-acid derived oxylipins, mainly the products of lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway, are implicated in defenses against pests and pathogens. Here, we report the identification of two non-JA producing, tonoplast-localized 9-LOXs, ZmLOX4 and ZmLOX5, that share 94% amino acid sequence identity to each other and play unique roles in defense to these pathogens. Remarkably, lox4 knock-out mutants are susceptible to ALB but resistant to SCLB, whereas lox5 mutants display the exact opposite phenotypes; they are resistant to C. graminicola, but susceptible to SCLB. These results suggest that the two duplicated paralogues evolved to specialize in conferring defense to these two pathogens with contrasting disease lifestyles. Metabolite analyses revealed that such functional divergence can be explained by the differential role of these highly related enzymes in the regulation of biosynthesis of the major defense hormones, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, in response to infection by these two pathogens.

## Abstract

Maize rough endosperm (rgh) mutants have defective kernels with a rough, etched, or pitted endosperm surface. Molecular genetic analysis of this mutant class has identified multiple RNA processing proteins critical to endosperm development. Here, we isolated the rgh6 mutant using forward genetic screen strategy from UniformMu transposon tagging population. The rgh6 mutant disrupts seed development with reduced endosperm size and shifted embryo position. The rgh6 mutant shows endosperm-embryo developmental interaction, in which normal embryo fails to develop in conjunction with mutant endosperm. Molecular cloning of the rgh6 locus suggested that it encodes a predicted DEAD-box RNA helicase. The Rgh6 transcripts is highly expressed in endosperm epidermal cells, and the RGH6 protein is localized to nucleolus and nuclear speckles. The rgh6 mutant shows increased precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), decreased mature miRNA, and increased miRNA targets accumulation, indicating that rgh6 is required for miRNA processing. Our study demonstrated that maize rgh6 is a predicted DEAD-box RNA helicase required for miRNA processing and endosperm differentiation.

## Abstract

Maize rough endosperm (rgh) mutants have defective kernels with a rough, etched, or pitted endosperm surface. Molecular genetic analysis of this mutant class has identified multiple RNA processing proteins critical to endosperm development. Here, we report on the developmental and molecular function of the rgh6 locus. The rgh6 mutant was isolated from the UniformMu transposon tagging population. Mutant kernels have reduced endosperm size and defective embryos that develop in a more apical position than typical for defective embryos. TB translocation crosses revealed that rgh6 mutant endosperm inhibits normal embryo development. Positional cloning of the rgh6 locus found that it encodes a predicted DEAD-box RNA helicase. Consistent with a predicted function for RNA processing, transient expression of a RGH6-GFP fusion protein is localized to nucleolus and nuclear speckles in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Rgh6 transcripts are highly expressed in endosperm epidermal cell types such as the aleurone, basal endosperm cell layer, embryo surrounding region, and endosperm adjacent to scutellum. Markers of these cell types show increased levels in rgh6 mutant kernels. Mutant endosperm tissues have increased precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) and decreased mature miRNA relative to normal sibling endosperm, indicating that rgh6 is required for miRNA processing. The transcript levels for most miRNA target genes accumulate to a higher level in rgh6 mutant tissue. These results suggest that miRNA processing and regulation of miRNA target genes are required for normal endosperm development.

## Abstract

85% of the maize genome is comprised of repeat elements of which 9.4% are tandem repeats called knobs. This equates to about ~1.5 Arabidopsis genomes of exclusively knob sequence. These knobs come in two classes (TR1 and knob180) differentiated by their repeat sequence. Abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10), a large selfish variant of chromosome 10, utilizes knob sequence to be preferentially transmitted to the next generation. Ab10 encodes both knob repeats as well as two kinesin proteins: kindr and trkin. kindr associates with knob180 knobs and trkin associates with TR1 knobs. kindr is responsible for the majority of Ab10 preferential transmission while the role of trkin is unclear. Several hypotheses have suggested that trkin may be improving the fitness of Ab10 in some way. We found that the frequency of meiotic errors did not differ between Ab10 homozygous plants with and without trkin. This suggests that trkin is unlikely to be improving Ab10 fitness by preventing meiotic errors in a meaningful way. Additionally, competition assays between variants of Ab10 demonstrated that trkin is responsible for the ability of K10L2, a trkin bearing N10 like chromosome 10 variant, to compete with Ab10. These data suggest that trkin and kindr may represent independent drive systems capitalizing on the same haplotype.

## Abstract

CRISPR-Cas systems provide powerful molecular toolboxes allowing precise changes in genomes. However, use of those molecular editors needs specific development for use in field seeds crops. Moreover, knock-out of key genes regulating important agronomic traits may be deleterious to plant yield or plant survival. Therefore, it is of interest to improve crops by creating specific allelic versions via precise single-nucleotide modification(s) which would provide trait of interest while retaining basic gene function. Such tools include Base Editors that can mediate substitutions. Amongst commonly used base editors are those associated with a Cas9 nickase to nick the non-edited DNA strand. Typically, the Cas9 nickase is fused to the base editor deaminase domain. Alternatively, it has been shown in rice that the nCas9 deaminase complex can be formed through an indirect interaction of the deaminase with a modified gRNA which then guided the base editor complex to the target. Here we show that the deaminase domain can be provided separately from Cas9 nickase to perform base editing. Although editing level is lower as compared to that obtained using a direct fusion, this strategy allows for a more flexible use of base editing since specific base-editing constructs are not required for use with alternative Cas systems. This approach may be of particular interest when optimizing components for base editing.

## Abstract

Porphyrins are tetrapyrrole required for all known lifeforms. Porphyrins include specialized molecules, including siroheme, cobalamin, heme, bilins, and chlorophyll, required for multiple metabolic processes and adaptative responses to environmental cues. The porphyrin biosynthetic enzymes Porphobilinogen Synthase, Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase, and Uroporphyrinogen III Synthase are conserved across all life on earth. Previously, the semi-dominant lesion-forming Les28-1 mutant was characterized as a Mu-suppressible allele, where lesion formation was increased by increasing the activity state of the Mutator transposons in Les28-1/+ plants. We extend these observations and demonstrate that Mu-killer, which epigenetically silences Mutatortransposon activity, also suppresses the lesion formation on Les28-1 plants. Analysis of sequences flanking Mu-insertions in Les28-1 that co-segregate with lesion formation identified an insertion in the first intron of maize uroporphyrinogen III synthase as the cause of the Les28-1 allele. A second insertion allele, in the 5’ UTR of this gene, was obtained from the photosynthetic mutant library at Oregon State University and found to encode a second Mu-suppressible allele, Les28-2, that resulted in semi-dominant and light-dependent lesion formation and recessive day-night-cycle-dependent necrotic stripe formation on leaves. Allelism tests between the two alleles produced yellow-seedling lethal offspring similar to recessive loss-of-function phenotypes in other steps in the porphyrin pathway. To discover naturally occurring alleles affecting variation in porphyrin metabolism, we scored the lesion phenotype in roughly five-thousand Les28-1/+ F1 plants obtained by crossing this mutant to an association mapping population. GWAS and candidate gene association detected epistatic effects on Les28-1 linked to genes in the porphyrin pathway, including the first committed steps of the heme, siroheme, and chlorophyll branches. This work provides evidence of cryptic standing variation in the maize germplasm via an epistatic interaction with novel genetic perturbation of an evolutionary conserved enzyme.

## Abstract

Water availability is one of major challenges for modern agriculture. This tension is exacerbated by extreme weather events and global climate change. In this context, understanding and controlling plant responses to drought have become crucial.Roots play essential roles in soil water uptake. The water uptake capacity of roots is determined by both the root system architecture (RSA) and its water permeability (hydraulics), which together shape the root hydraulic architecture. In the present project, we aim to explore the natural genetic variation of maize root hydraulic architecture to identify key molecular and genetic components and investigate their impact on plant drought responses.We examined root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr), a measure of root water permeability, in 224 maize Dent inbred lines under non-drought conditions (Rishmawi et al., 2023, Plant Physiol. 192:2404-2418). This revealed significant natural variations in the Lpr of primary roots during an 11 to 12-day growth period. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) lead to the identification of 6 QTLs with 8 underlying candidate genes. These genes are involved in many biological pathways such as amino acid metabolism, ethylene signaling, and vascular development.We took two genetic validation approaches for these QTLs: confirming allelic effects on Lpr using bi-parental recombinant populations and verifying the function of candidate genes through knock-out mutants created by transposon insertion or CRISPR-Cas9. Our results demonstrate a distinct allelic effect on Lpr at the identified QTL loci. Furthermore, mutant analysis for select candidate genes suggests their involvement in the regulation of Lpr in both maize and Arabidopsis roots.Currently, we are investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the candidate genes based on their predicted mode of action. Gene-based association mapping will provide detailed insights into causal allelic variations. Subsequently, we will explore the effects of these alleles or genes under various drought conditions.

## Abstract

Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Monech) is a crop of tremendous significance. Grain sorghum is cultivated for consumption by humans and livestock alike worldwide and is valued for its resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, sorghum grain protein is deficient in essential amino acids and has low digestibility. Furthermore, sorghum does not yield flour with desirable bread making properties. These nutritional shortcomings can be attributed to the structure and amino acid content of the kafirin storage proteins that constitute >70% of proteins expressed in the endosperm that form low-digestibility protein bodies. This study was conducted to evaluate nutritional and biochemical characteristics of reduced kafirin, low-amylose sorghum grain. Previously, a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) construct was used to target members of the alpha-kafirin gene family, k1C, which reduced kafirin expression in endosperm cells and elicited a proteome re-balance wherein the increase in nonkafirin expression and reduction in protein body morphology would increase lysine and improve digestibility of the grain. Additionally, introgression of the waxya mutant into k1C-edited F1 sorghum was performed to confer the low-amylose starch trait to improve the dough-making potential of sorgum grain. Here, we report on results from a highly-inbred edited line with ~400kb of the k1C family (12 active genes) deleted. These results include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of protein bodies, dissecting microscope imagery of endosperm texture, protein-bound and free amino acid profile, and kafirin and non-kafirin sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE). The results of these tests will provide insight into the nutritional and biophysical properties of sorghum grain produced from this novel genotypic combination.

## Abstract

Drought and heat stress limit maize growth and development, decreasing annual yield in many regions worldwide. As temperatures continue to rise, tropical regions will be disproportionately affected, adversely impacting the quality and production of agricultural products, requiring integrated management practices and the adoption of stress-resistant varieties to mitigate losses. Maize plants evolved different morphological and physiological mechanisms to grow under water-limited conditions, affecting several agronomic traits, but only a few major genes were reported associated with yield. At the Genomics for Climate Change Research Center (GCCRC), we study both genes of unknown function involved in drought response in extremophile plants and genes of the alternative respiratory pathway from cultivated species. After a significant increase in shoot and root biomass under water restriction in a greenhouse experiment, different events overexpressing the UCP1 (Uncoupling protein 1) from Arabidopsis thaliana or an uncharacterized gene (gccrc candidate gene 20) from a halophyte species were tested in the field under well water and drought conditions in two maize genetic backgrounds (B104xCML488 and B104xCML360) during the Brazilian second season in 2023. We observed variation among events in agronomic and yield components for each gene. Some events demonstrated superior performance compared to the controls. In the B104xCML360 background under drought conditions, both genes contributed to an increase in yield components, whereas in the B104xCML488 background, they did not have the same effect. While CML488 is a drought-tolerant line adapted to the Africa CYMMIT program, CML360 is adapted to acid soils from South America. Field phenotyping of additional genes is in progress in the GCCRC pipeline.

## Abstract

Phosphorus (P) is the second most important macronutrient for plant growth, and despite being present in soils in significant amounts, its availability to plants is limited due to various pH-dependent complexations with soil minerals. The production of inorganic P fertilizers is highly energy-intensive and is directly tied to the consumption of phosphate rock (PR), a nonrenewable resource that is expected to be depleted within the next 50-80 years. Symbiosis of crops with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is a promising avenue to enhance phosphorus use efficiency. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which AMF promotes phosphate utilization in plants, especially maize, are largely unknown. To identify the physiological processes and pathways that facilitate the mobilization and uptake of P, we profiled the metabolome and proteome of maize roots grown under axenic conditions with and without AMF association. We show that localized changes (>8 times) in benzoxazinoids, a tryptophan-derived secondary metabolite, and carbohydrate metabolism have a major role in root-AMF interactions. At the proteome level, upregulation of flavin-containing monooxygenase, plant lipid transfer protein, putative sugar-phosphate/phosphate translocator, and SnRK1-interacting protein is associated with the symbiosis. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the signaling nexus underlying root mycorrhizae interaction that improves P utilization.

## Abstract

Many phytopathogens translocate virulence (effector) proteins into plant cells to circumvent host immune responses during infection. One such pathogen is Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which secretes at least thirty-six effectors into host cells, of which a subset elicit host defense responses in crop plant species such as wheat. However, it is unknown whether P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is capable of activating immune responses in maize inbreds. We, therefore, screened a diverse maize germplasm collection for effector-dependent recognition of this bacterial pathogen. As a control, we infiltrated Pseudomonas syringae DC3000(D36E), a derivative of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that lacks all endogenous effectors. In our evaluations, we observed a variety of responses to P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in maize and scored the phenotypes as either no observable response (N) or as one of three responses: weak chlorosis (WC), chlorosis (C) with minimal cell death, and hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death. Of the twenty-six maize inbreds screened, 13 were scored as N, 2 as WC, 2 as C, and 9 as HR-like cell death. Importantly, no maize line responded to P. syringae DC3000(D36E), demonstrating the phenotypic responses observed are likely dependent upon recognition of one or more P. syringae effectors. Consistent with the phenotypic responses, maize inbred lines that recognize P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 accumulated detectable hydrogen peroxide within the infiltrated regions as well as an increase in transcript expression of a subset of maize defense genes. Collectively, our results reveal P. syringae induces defense responses in diverse maize inbreds. Our results, therefore, suggest that diverse maize inbred lines likely encode disease resistance proteins that recognize the activities of one or more P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 effectors.

## Abstract

Protein acetylation is a major post-translational modification that modulates many cellular processes, including plant immunity and stress responses. Cochlibolus carbonum (Northern Corn Leaf Spot) produces the effector HC-Toxin, a lysine deacetylase inhibitor required for pathogen virulence. RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2) is a transcriptional corepressor homologous to TOPLESS (TPL) in Arabidopsis. TPL family members are required for various biological processes, including development and immunity, and are critical components of hormone responses, including auxin and jasmonate signaling pathways. We identified a lysine acetylation site on REL2 using global acetylome profiling of maize treated with HC-Toxin or C. carbonum. Furthermore, we found that rel2 loss of function mutant plants are susceptible to infection, demonstrating that REL2 is directly related to plant immunity. Lastly, we have created an integrated gene regulatory network with mass-spec-based proteomics and transcriptomics that give insight into how REL2 plays a role in maize immunity. This work aims to elucidate how hyperacetylation impacts the biological activity of REL2 and REL2’s roles in plant-pathogen interactions to gain a detailed molecular understanding of plant immunity and to reconstruct a model for how REL2 transcriptionally regulates plant pathogen response.

## Abstract

Invertases are essential to developing kernels and other tissues that depend on import of sucrose transported from leaves. These enzymes are pivotal to sucrose and catalyze the first step in its metabolism. In addition, vacuolar invertases can link sucrose import to cellular expansion in growing tissues. The Ivr1 invertase is expressed primarily in male plant parts (anthers and pollen), whereas Ivr2 localizes to female parts (silks) and root tips. Together they can markedly impact pollination success. The Ivr1 gene also shows a "domestication signature" suggesting a selective advantage during ancient breeding and emphasizing its biological significance. The goal of this work is to determine the contributions by each of these invertases to pollination biology of maize. Genetic materials (knock-out mutants) have been developed that will allow individual roles to be tested. Four distinct lines with mutant alleles disrupting the Ivr genes at different sites have been confirmed, two disrupting the Ivr1 gene and two disrupting the Ivr2 gene. These provide a foundation for in-depth exploration. Phenotypical analysis of invertase mutants are ongoing, with preliminary results showing an increased anthesis silking interval and stunted pollen germination in the mutants of both the Ivr1 and Ivr2 genes; two factors pivotal to pollination success. Molecular analyses by PCR and qPCR will parallel field studies to quantify the expression of both genes at crucial sites during pollination, particularly in tissues of rapid cellular expansion, such as the silks and the filaments. In an era of growing demand for sustainable food production, understanding the intricate genetic underpinnings of yields from vital crop species like maize is essential. This research will help dissect complex genetic interactions that sustain a crop that feeds the world, with far-reaching implications for agricultural innovation and global food security.

## Abstract

Crop herbicide tolerance traits are important for weed management and crop yield. However, continuous herbicide application has driven weeds to evolve herbicide resistance which challenges corn production. Therefore, creating new herbicide tolerance trait is essential to reduce herbicide resistance evolution in weeds and sustain crop yield. Expression of a microbial HemG-type protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, PPO_H_N90, in crops enabled tolerance to PPO-inhibiting herbicides in Bayer. In this study, PPO_H_N90 was inserted to a pre-selected target site in corn genome by Site-Directed Integration (SDI) technology. After several rounds of self-pollination and selection, one lead event was identified to contain a single, intact and full-length PPO_H-N90 gene at the target site without backbone and SDI machinery, and PPO expression was detected in the lead event. In field trials, the lead event showed excellent tolerance to PPO-inhibiting herbicides, while the agronomic traits were not affected by PPO expression and application of PPO-inhibiting herbicides.

## Abstract

Transcription factors (TFs) have various functions in plant development. In a model crop like Maize, there are thousands of TFs and due to the sheer amount of them, we don’t know the function of many. I have developed a system to systematically explore TF function with the use of high throughput ectopic expression of individual TFs. Ectopic expression of TFs induces the native pathways and with that information we can begin to tease apart the native function of those TFs. We have established methods for high-throughput transformation of leaf protoplasts in 384-well plates. Median transformation efficiencies are >70% and consistent between days and across the plates. We have used this to express 164 individual TFs in duplicate and measure the full transcriptome-wide response by RNA sequencing. Replicate samples consistently show a higher Pearson's correlation than random sample pairs. 30% of TFs cluster immediately next to their replicate, indicating that many TFs induce reproducible responses and the responses are sufficiently distinct to drive clustering. We also find evidence supporting that at least some of the genes induced are likely direct TF targets. For example, the knotted1 (kn1) motif is enriched in the promoters of genes induced by kn1 overexpression. In the next steps, we will continue the established workflow through the remainder of the cloned maize TFome, producing a resource for the plant community.

## Abstract

Phyllachora maydis, an obligate fungal pathogen, causes tar spot, a severe maize foliar disease impacting global corn production. Tar spot symptoms appear as small, raised, irregularly shaped black lesions called stromata scattered on leaves, stalks, and husks. In severe cases, stromata can be surrounded by brown, elliptical necrotic halos known as fisheye lesions inducing extensive necrosis, premature senescence, and plant death. Fisheye lesions have been previously linked with Microdochium maydis in Mexico, but its presence in the United States has not yet been confirmed. The molecular basis of pathogenicity of P. maydis resulting in tar spot and fisheye symptoms remains poorly understood. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of tar spot stromata with and without fisheye lesions to compare their transcriptomes and identify genes and pathways associated with each symptom. Comparative analysis revealed distinct and significantly differentially expressed gene patterns (DEGs) associated with each symptom. Notably, reads from P. maydis were dominant in both samples, alongside unknown taxa from suborders Masssarineae and Pleosporinae, suggesting the presence of additional unidentified species. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis further revealed that P. maydis was 92.6% and 92.0% complete in both samples, while Massarineae was 58.5% and 83.7% complete and Pleosporinae was only 4% and 8.9% complete. These findings suggest the existence of new, unknown taxa associated with tar spot with fisheye lesions and highlight both common and distinct genes and pathways associated with tar spot with and without fisheye lesions. Further exploration of the identified findings could lead to valuable insights into P. maydis pathogenicity and potentially contribute to the development of targeted disease control strategies.

## Abstract

Controlling meiotic recombination will allow utilizing larger numbers of allele combinations in breeding programs and make plant breeding more efficient. To do it, we are developing methods to stimulate recombination at specific genome loci. Since meiotic recombination starts with double-strand breaks (DSB) introduced into chromosomal DNA by the SPO11 protein complex, we target the SPO11-1 protein to defined sites in the maize genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In this approach, SPO11-1 fused to a catalytically inactivated dCas9 protein is directed using guide RNAs (gRNAs) to the targeted loci, where it is expected to generate DSBs. Increasing DSB frequencies should lead to higher crossover numbers. To test the efficiency of DSB formation, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation with a DSB repair protein RAD51. To test crossover formation, we utilize a high-throughput pollen typing method, in which sperm cell nuclei are isolated using fluorescence-activated flow sorting and then genotyped with digital droplet PCR. Not all DSBs result in crossovers, depending on factors such as the chromatin state and the level of inter-parental DNA sequence polymorphism. In addition to potential practical applications of this research, we hope to shed light on factors affecting DSB fate.

## Abstract

Plant disease resistance proteins of the nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) type are activated upon recognition of specific pathogen-derived effector proteins and induce a strong defense response, known as effector-triggered immunity or ETI, which often includes a rapid localized cell death known as the hypersensitive cell death defense response (HR). The maize NLR protein Rp1-D21, an autoactive derivative of the Rp1-D common rust resistance protein, triggers a spontaneous HR in the absence of pathogen challenge. ZmCER9, a member of the E3 ligase family associated with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), emerges as a crucial player in this process. Through genome-wide association (GWA) mapping, we identified ZmCER9 as a candidate among the modifier loci influencing Rp1-D21-induced HR. Our study characterizes ZmCER9 as an active E3 ligase localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the proteasome-dependent degradation of Rp1-D21. Intriguingly, ZmCER9 exhibits a broader spectrum of influence, suppressing and directing the degradation of autoactive NLRs from maize, Arabidopsis, and barley. Extending our investigation to Arabidopsis, we observe an increased hypersensitive response (HR) to specific pathogens in the absence of AtCER9, highlighting the conservation of the CER9-mediated degradation mechanism across plant species. In conclusion, our findings unveil a previously undiscovered process in plants involving ZmCER9 and the ERAD system, providing insights into the degradation of NLR proteins of immune homeostasis.

## Abstract

Purple maize kernels are characterized by the accumulation of anthocyanins in the pericarp tissue. As water soluble pigments, anthocyanins are of interest to the food industry as natural food dyes. Anthocyanins possess health-promoting properties and are shown to reduce biomarkers associated with inflammation, diabetes, and adipogenesis (Zhang et al., 2019). To understand the genetics influencing anthocyanin accumulation during purple maize kernel development, we conducted an RNA-seq study on pericarp tissues collected from three near-isogenic purple maize cultivars and B73 at 10, 15, and 20 days after pollination (DAP). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis identified significantly up- and down-regulated genes that are functionally characterized as involved in flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic processes across developmental stages. For example, Hct10 and a novel P450 gene model are significantly upregulated at 10 DAP. In an anthocyanin rich B73 isoline, 10 and 15 DAP were enriched in flavonoid, anthocyanin, and luteolin biosynthetic processes, while 20 DAP exhibited increased enrichment for phenylpropanoid processes. This study identifies metabolic loci associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis, as well as potential candidate genes. Future analysis of the data using variant calling software can pinpoint allelic variation for marker-assisted selection for increased anthocyanin concentration.

## Abstract

Fast Flowering Mini Maize (FFMM) is a line that has a generation time under two months. It is being used worldwide for various studies, particularly those needing controlled environments, and by those who desire quick results. We are developing methods to use FFMM to expedite maize transformation and gene editing. FFMM has been transformed using BabyBoom (BBM) and Wuschel (WUS), but subsequently with only WUS2 to minimize the effect on plant morphology. Constructs have been assembled for the eventual stacking of multiple transgenes in FFMM with the ability to remove the selectable marker and WUS2. A landing site on a GFP marked B chromosome for insertion via recombination mediated by phiC31 recombinase has been introgressed into FFMM for multiple generations. Insertions into this B chromosome will permit extensive dosage analyses of the transformed genes. Gene editing within FFMM was demonstrated by mutating the nondisjunction factor gene on a phenotypically marked B chromosome introgressed into FFMM. A haploid inducer derivative of FFMM has been produced that has GFP and RUBY phenotypic markers that will aid in the identification of haploids. With the addition of editing constructs to this inducer, the ability to edit any target line via Haploid Induction-Edit with an expedited timeframe will be possible. Various approaches are being tried to reduce the transformation time as much as possible.

## Abstract

Meiotic recombination involves the programmed exchange of DNA material between homologous chromosomes, known as crossing-over (CO). In maize, as in many other higher eukaryotes, only a small fraction of the genome (approximately 5%) harbors COs. Furthermore, CO sites are mostly clustered at defined genomic locations called CO hotspots. In maize mechanisms that maintain CO hotspots and establish new ones remain poorly understood. Our research indicates that decreased nucleosomes density and reduced DNA methylation are critical features of CO sites in maize. Thus, changing the chromatin state may impact CO landscape. To test this hypothesis in maize, we investigated the effects of chromatin structure changes on meiotic recombination using two maize mutants: decreased DNA methylation (ddm1) and methyltransferase2 (zmet2). These studies demonstrated that mutations of the Ddm1 and Zmet2 genes resulted in an increased number of COs and reshuffled CO patterning chromosome-wide. The ddm1 mutation increased CO numbers by 70% and lead to the formation of new CO hotspots at distal chromosome sites, while the zmet2 mutation boosted COs by 22% and redirected them to interstitial chromosome segments. Interestingly, both mutants displayed COs at genomic sites where COs are not detected in wild type. Detailed analysis of the CO sites in the mutants revealed two separate mechanisms of unlocking genomic loci for recombination. COs ddm1 exhibited reduced DNA methylation but no significant changes in nucleosome density, whereas COs in zmet2 showed decreased nucleosome density without a substantial decrease in DNA methylation. These results demonstrate that altering in chromatin structure can unleash meiotic recombination in chromosome regions that are normally recombination inert, therefore possible will be to create recombination landscape by design.

## Abstract

Flowering teosinte initiates several small female inflorescences in each leaf axil compared to domesticated maize that produces only a single large one. A major QTL controlling this phenotype, prol1.1, maps to a 2.7 Kb region upstream of the grassy tillers1 (gt1) homeodomain leucine zipper gene known to play a role in repression of tillering and carpel abortion in tassels. Our previous work identified a potential KNOX homeodomain binding site at pro1.1 that was confirmed via ChIP-sequencing using a KNOTTED1 (KN1) antibody. Because KNOX homeodomain proteins are known to dimerize with BLH homeobox proteins, we investigated whether a KNOX/BLH complex could bind to prol1.1. From transcription profiling we discovered that gt1 transcripts are highly downregulated in blh12/14 mutants that are defective in intermediate vein patterning, making the functionally redundant BLH12/14 proteins good candidates to be members of a complex. Furthermore, pull-down experiments indicated that KN1 and BLH12 or BLH14 proteins could physically interact as a complex in vivo. To verify potential binding at prol1.1, ChIP-seq using a BLH14 specific antibody on male and female inflorescence chromatin was done. This confirmed binding of BLH proteins to prol1.1, with a binding peak that overlaps completely with the KN1 peak. Interestingly, GT1 imunolocalization in kn1 or blh12/14 mutant backgrounds revealed reduced expression in axillary meristems, both vegetative and floral. This finding, together with the RNAseq results, indicate that the KNOX/BLH complex functions to activate gt1 in axillary positions where it may function to repress growth. This activation, however, occurs within a window after axillary meristem formation, but before lateral organ initiation as a mechanism to prevent excess branching late in development.

## Abstract

Plant development emerges from stem cell populations called meristems, which control organ initiation and branching. RAMOSA3 (RA3), a classical maize developmental gene, controls inflorescence branching, and encodes a trehalose phosphate phosphatase enzyme. Our recent genetic and cell biology studies found that RA3 has a potentially non-enzymatic moonlighting function, since its phenotype can be uncoupled from catalytic activity. Furthermore, RA3 protein phase separates and forms nuclear speckles, suggesting that it associates with transcriptional regulatory machinery in the nucleus. To tackle the mystery of the nuclear moonlighting function of RA3, we performed ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis and screening of ra3 mutants, and identified an enhancer, indeterminate spikelet1 (ids1). IDS1 is an AP2 type transcription factor that controls spikelet and floret development. By carefully examining the early developmental stages of ra3;ids1 double mutants, we found that floral meristems were transformed into branches, rather than forming florets. We confirmed these findings by crossing ra3 with additional ids1 alleles and conducting allelism tests. Using in-situ hybridization, we found RA3 and IDS1 were co-expressed in the boundary regions between floral meristems, which was also supported by our single-cell transcriptomic profiling data. To further examine if IDS1 might be involved in the hypothetical transcriptional regulatory function of RA3, we checked for physical interactions between RA3 and IDS1 in planta. Indeed, we found that RA3 and IDS1 proteins interact in nuclear speckles, reminiscent of the nuclear speckle localization of RA3. By further performing RNA-seq for ra3 and ids1 single and double mutants, we identified downstream candidate genes that were co-regulated by the putative RA3-IDS1 complex. Together, our data suggest that RA3 had a nuclear regulatory role in controlling inflorescence branching by interacting with the transcription factor, IDS1.

## Abstract

The ligule is a grass-specific leaf appendage that, along with the auricle, comprises the blade-sheath boundary. Ligule initiation from the adaxial epidermis of developing leaf primordia is the first morphological demarcation of the blade and sheath. This patterning event has become a classic developmental model for studies on cell fate diversification in grasses. However, gene regulatory networks that control the precise formation of this unique structure remain largely unknown. We identified the conserved LITTLE ZIPPER-ROLLED LEAF1/REVOLUTA (ZPR-RLD1/REV) module as a key regulator of maize ligule development. Disrupting three ZPR genes (ZmZPR3, ZmZPR4a, and ZmZPR4b) simultaneously caused defective ligule formation and upright leaf blades. Subsequent genetic analysis of single, double, and triple Zmzpr mutants revealed redundant functions within the ZPR family, highlighting their collective requirement for proper ligule formation. Arabidopsis ZPR proteins were previously shown to interact with REV, an HD-ZIPIII transcription factor that promotes ad/abaxial polarity during leaf development. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we confirmed protein-protein interactions between all three ZmZPR proteins and RLD1/ZmREV1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis REV. Previously reported mis-expression of RLD1/ZmREV1 in dominant Rld1 mutants notably induces ectopic ligule development on the abaxial leaf surface at the blade-sheath boundary, underscoring its critical role in establishing the ligule. Additionally, we examined genetic interactions between triple Zmzpr mutants and liguleless2 (lg2) and found that quadruple mutant leaves phenocopied lg2, suggesting that the LG2 encoded bZIP domain TGA transcription factor may be a downstream target of the ZmZPRs in ligule development. This, along with overlapping mRNA expression patterns of ZmZPRs, RLD1/ZmREV1, and LG2 in leaf primordia, highlights a diverse function of the ZPR-REV regulatory module in maize. Taken together, our findings unveil the ZPR-REV module as a novel regulator of ligule formation, potentially mediated through LG2 regulation.

## Abstract

A comprehensive understanding of inflorescence development is crucial for crop genetic improvement, as inflorescence meristems give rise to reproductive organs and determine grain yield. However, dissecting inflorescence development at the cellular level has been challenging owing to a lack of specific marker genes to distinguish among cell types, particularly in different types of meristems that are vital for organ formation. In this study, we used spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) to construct a precise spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear primordium, identifying twelve cell types, including the four newly cell types found mainly in the inflorescence meristem. By extracting the meristem components for detailed clustering, we identified three subtypes of meristem, and validated two MADS-box genes that were specifically expressed at the apex of determinate meristems and involved in stem cell determinacy. Furthermore, by integrating single-cell RNA transcriptomes, we identified a series of spatially-specific networks and hub genes that may provide new insights into the formation of different tissues. In summary, this study provides a valuable resource for studies of cereal inflorescence development studies, offering new clues for yield improvement.

## Abstract

Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) is an economically important tree nut that commonly thrives in semi-arid and arid environments. P. vera is a highly adaptable to various abiotic stresses, and it can tolerate drought and salinity stresses, which makes it suitable for reforestation of arid and salinized zones. However, the mechanisms underlying the salinity tolerance of this plant are not well understood. The present study was aimed at physiological and molecular investigations to unravel the metabolic pathways associated with the salt tolerance mechanisms in UCB-1 cultivar. Five one-year-old pistachio rootstocks were treated with four saline water regimes for 100 days. The rootstocks adopted Na+ exclusion strategy to resist the salinity stress. Total proteins were isolated from the roots and treated with different NaCl concentrations. The proteins were characterized using high throughput LC-MS/MS spectrometry searched against the Citrus database. Over 1600 protein IDs were detected, among which the comparative analysis revealed 245 more abundant and 190 low abundant proteins to three stress levels. The proteins associated with amino acid metabolism, cell wall organization, protein homeostasis, response to stress, signal transduction, TCA cycle, and vesicular trafficking were constantly overexpressed at all stress levels. At low and moderate stress levels, the chromatin and cytoskeleton organization lipid metabolism proteins were overexpressed, while at higher salt concentrations, they were unaffected. Transcription and translation processes were affected by all stress levels, as the proteins showed down-regulation in response to all stress levels. Transcription proteins were downregulated at low and moderate stress while overexpressed at high salt stress treatment. Protein interaction network with all the orthologous proteins mapped to Arabidopsis thaliana and the clusters associated with these proteins revealed the cytosolic, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism are associated with salinity stress.

## Abstract

The Fowler lab is interested in pollen development and how it relates to plant reproduction, particularly in maize. Previous work has shown that for at least one pollen mutant, stt1, reduced pollen grain size correlates with reduced pollen grain germination (Phillips, 2011). As such, it would be beneficial to investigate the variation and breadth of pollen grain size and shape phenotypes across maize lines, including specific mutants impacting pollen fitness, as well as inbred lines capturing the genetic diversity across the species. A single maize plant can produce several million pollen grains, all containing unique haploid genomes following meiosis, and such large populations could be utilized to generate rich phenotypic datasets. This project is developing the automation of large-scale pollen grain measurements. Key to this approach are the plating of pollen, the microscope utilized, automation of the imaging process, and the ability to selectively differentiate and measure objects in accordance with user-specified parameters. The current working model is adapted from established approaches used for measurement of microscopic features like nuclei (Schindelin et al, 2012). This approach has been validated with an established pollen grain size mutant (stt1). Preliminary results demonstrate that this approach can be used to detect differences in ploidy, or detection of aberrant pollen morphology. Additionally, we have identified subpopulations of differing size in single heterozygous populations (stt1, stt2, and stt3) as well as in double heterozygous populations (MDR1 / DNG102), which we are using to validate the robustness of this approach when applied to complex or mixed populations of pollen.

## Abstract

Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is the intermediate in the two-step pathway of trehalose biosynthesis mediated by T6P-synthase (TPS) and T6P-phosphatase (TPP). Plants harbor small families of TPS and TPP genes and most plant TPSs lack enzymatic activity, suggesting they might have regulatory functions. In maize, the classical mutant ramosa3 (ra3) increases inflorescence branching and RA3 encodes a catalytic TPP. To further explore the molecular mechanism of RA3’s functions, we screened for its interactors and found that RA3 interacts with ZmTPS1 and ZmTPS12, two non-catalytic TPSs. zmtps1 and zmtps12 mutants enhance ra3 phenotypes, suggesting their interaction is biologically significant. Interestingly, we found that ZmTPS1 also interacts with the two catalytic active TPSs, ZmTPS11 and ZmTPS14. We knocked out these genes using CRISPR-Cas9, and zmtps11;zmtps14 double mutants fail to complete embryogenesis, suggesting that the active TPSs are important for embryo development, as in Arabidopsis. Next, to ask if the TPS-TPP interactions affect enzyme activity, we performed a coupled enzyme assay, and found that the non-catalytic ZmTPS1 stimulated the coupled activity of RA3 and ZmTPS14. This result also suggested that RA3, ZmTPS1, and ZmTPS14 form a complex, and we confirmed it by expressing and purifying the three proteins from insect cells. Moving forward, we will visualize the complex by cryo-electron microscopy. This will allow first insights into the structural basis and stoichiometry of TPS-TPP interactions, which have not been studied in any organism.In summary, our results suggest that a maize TPP (RA3) functions in a complex with both non-catalytic and catalytic active TPSs, and the non-catalytic TPS stimulates the activity of the active enzymes. Our research also provided insights for the first time into the combined activity of the two major trehalose gene classes, TPSs and TPPs, in plant development.

## Abstract

Big embryo7 (Bige7) encodes the BRIZ1 subunit of the universally conserved BRAP/BRIZ E3 ligase, implicated in animal cell cycle regulation and pleiotropic roles in plant development. The suite of bige7 phenotypes includes defects in seed germination, aleurone differentiation, meiosis II, and male gametophyte development. Interestingly, the latter two phenotypes occur in heterozygotes. Reciprocal crosses confirmed normal transmission through the female. Analyses of pollen morphology and germination rates have thus far not established a basis for reduced transmission. However, abnormal tetrad shapes in bige7/+ anthers are attributed to one cell of the dyad mis-dividing while the other cell divides normally. Both this pattern, and pollen transmission ratio, are consistent with uncovering of recessive bige7 in dyad cells by meiosis I segregation. To test the meiosis I segregation hypothesis, bige7 was crossed with inbred Ki11, which carries a knob (K2S) that is linked to the BigE7 locus, both on 2S. Dividing dyad meiocytes and tetrad microspores from F1 anthers were genotyped for knob constitution by FISH using a K-180 probe. Inferred dyad bige7 genotypes were then correlated with meiosis II division angles measured by 3D rendering and image processing using ICY and ImageJ. Meiosis II division angles of homozygous recessive bige7 dyad cells showed significantly larger deviations from normal division compared to heterozygous and wild type dyad cells, providing unambiguous support for the Meiosis I segregation hypothesis. The hypothesis has striking implications: 1) BigE7 is transcribed in dyads during the brief interkinesis stage of meiosis, and 2) fates of bige7 microspores depend on the genotype of their diploid dyad progenitor implying an unexpected connection between meiosis II division and microspore development. Because few essential genes are thought to be expressed during interkinesis, meiosis I segregation is assumed to have little impact on male fitness. In contrast, the bige7 phenotype challenges that assumption.

## Abstract

Increased drought due to climate change has exacerbated soil salinization, particularly in agricultural systems where irrigation practices already contribute to excessive salt accumulation. Salt stress is a major constraint on maize yield, and has been shown to stunt root and shoot growth and decrease lateral root count. In order to study the mechanisms of stress response and development in maize, we are investigating metabolites localized to the meristem region of maize roots exposed to salt stress. Since the meristem is the site of stem cell differentiation, metabolite localization to this region could indicate increased growth response during stress, revealing an uncharacterized role of metabolic stress signaling. To determine spatial localization of metabolites during stress, we are developing a new data analysis pipeline for mass spectrometry imaging that combines data collected from desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI), high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and computational analysis to determine and confirm chemical composition and spatial localization. These techniques identified the sugar D-erythrose, a compound that localizes to the meristem region of maize roots. We found that salt-stressed maize treated with D-erythrose conferred phenotypic rescue in root growth. Phosphorylated erythrose is a known intermediate in the Calvin cycle and shikimate pathway, which are important for energy and amino acid production. Current investigations show that D-erythrose treatment significantly rescues root growth compared to the same concentration of D-sucrose treatment, suggesting an additional effect beyond providing energy supply. Erythrose could have important applications in terms of stress response signaling or have other roles in plant development regulation. We are continuing to characterize the role of erythrose during salt stress using chemical and genetic approaches.

## Abstract

Plant growth is dependent on multicellular vascular bundles and their ability to conduct water. The majority of water transport in maize is accomplished by xylem vessel elements, protoxylem and metaxylem. Vessel element cells are excellent water conductors because they undergo Programmed Cell Death (PCD), a process that is regulated by NAC and MYB family genes. The classical maize mutant, wilted1 (wi1), exhibits a water transport defect linked to xylem vessel element production. Although protoxylem in wi1 develops normally, its metaxylem is delayed, resulting in a dwarfed and water deficient phenotype. Chromosome walking localized wi1 to a 82 Mbp interval on chromosome 6 including the centromere. Analysis of 20 F2 individuals showed that wi1 fits expectations for a single recessive allele. We characterized stem metaxylem in a 1:1 wi1:WT population and found that wi1 plants lack metaxylem in the lowest internodes at the V5 growth stage, before any obvious stress response. Using our early phenotyping method, we prepared RNA from 6 wi1 and 4 WT individuals for RNA sequencing and differential gene expression analysis. Our RNAseq identified 1174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wi1 and WT, with 76% of DEGs upregulated in wi1, suggesting that WI1 is a transcriptional repressor. GO Term enrichment suggests that plant stress and transcriptional regulation are upregulated in wi1, while photosynthesis and cell expansion are downregulated in wi1. While we originally anticipated wi1 to be derived from a loss of function of a NAC or MYB within the mapping interval on chromosome 6, we instead find the most likely candidate gene to be a complex locus that contains Zm00001eb265940, Zm00001eb266010, and Zm00001eb266000, annotated as one alpha mannosidase - lipase pseudogene, LOC103630979 in the NCBI NAMv5.0 assembly. Ongoing work aims to confirm the structure of this transcript by RT-PCR and determine its protein coding potential.

## Abstract

Cells in the root tips of B73 and NC350 maize lines replicate their DNA in approximately 3 hours in a highly regulated, temporally ordered process. By using a multi-inbred approach, we aim to characterize the evolution and conservation of DNA replication in maize. We employed a flow cytometric and DNA copy number protocol to assign a replication time (RT) to every region of the maize genome. DNA copy number methods rely on precise, high quality mapping protocols. Therefore, we developed an in silico strategy to identify segments of maize reference genomes with low inherent “mappability”, which we employed as drop lists during downstream genomic analysis. Using nuclei collected by flow sorting, we obtained a ratio of the read numbers at each locus for nuclei in S phase relative to those in G1 phase. Because loci replicating early in S phase will have higher copy numbers, this data can be used to assign a replication time to each locus. Comparison between NC350 and B73 replication programs is particularly interesting considering NC350's tropical lineage, larger genome size, and higher knob count than other NAM lines. Centromere and knob regions typically replicate later in S phase, which makes these genomic areas and the genes around them of special interest. While most genes replicate at a similar time in S phase in these two maize inbred lines, there are some notable differences. This project aims to uncover regions where the timing of DNA replication diverges between B73 and NC350 and to explore the genomic and genetic contexts that influence replication time.

## Abstract

Stomata regulate leaf gas exchange of CO2 and water vapor, i.e. water use efficiency (WUE). Stomatal development has been studied as a model system for understanding regulation of cell fate, and to reveal how stomatal patterning influences leaf gas exchange. However, the genetic architecture of stomatal patterning is primarily understood only for the coarse, composite traits stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index (SI). Stomatal patterning is flexible, so multiple genotypes can possess equivalent SD or SI while possessing different epidermal cell sizes/patterns. Therefore, analyzing the component traits underlying SD would be valuable. Optical tomography and AI-enabled computer vision can now rapidly generate large data sets of the relative positions of stomata on the epidermis. This study used such data from a B73 x Ms71 mapping population to develop a novel method that statistically summarizes the self-repeating mosaic, or tessellation, of stomata on the maize leaf surface in terms of 2D kernel density distributions (KDDs). A set of traits describing variation in the KDDs was subjected to principle components analysis and structural equation modeling for dimension reduction and to assess trait interactions. The trait set includes features consistent with known developmental mechanisms regulating independent elements of patterning along the medial versus longitudinal axes of the leaf. Linear models featuring the core trait set explained 74% of the variation in SD. Ten quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SD also associated with KDD-derived patterning traits. Seven SD QTL were exclusively associated with medial KDD-derived traits. Three QTL were associated with both medial and longitudinal KDD-derived traits. Medial QTL also colocalized with specific leaf area QTL i.e. measures of leaf blade thickness and density. Overall, these spatial methods provide a case study for atomizing histology into orthogonal components, identifying their distinct genetic drivers, and refining our understanding of how complex traits like SD arise.

## Abstract

Phytohormones play crucial roles in regulating plant growth, development, and environmental responses. Extensive studies in model plants such as Arabidopsis have demonstrated that plant hormones can have distinct, overlapping, and antagonistic functions. For example, both auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) can inhibit root growth and JA-auxin crosstalk has been well-studied in Arabidopsis. Root growth inhibition by JA and auxin in maize suggests that these hormones may also be integrated during maize root morphogenesis. To address this knowledge gap, we are employing hormone response assays, gene expression analyses, and in vivo quantification of hormone levels. An auxin signaling mutant, arf27, exhibited insensitivity to JA compared to wild-type W22 seedlings. JA biosynthesis and signaling genes are decreased in arf27 compared to W22 based on RNA-seq data, which is in line the arf27 JA response phenotype. To determine if these transcriptional changes can impact hormone levels in vivo, hormone levels will be examined in W22 and arf27 in the presence or absence of exogenous auxin treatment. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into JA-auxin crosstalk during maize root development.

## Abstract

Maize tassels contain thousands of anthers, which produce the male gametophyte, pollen. Fully differentiated pre-meiotic anthers are composed of four concentric somatic cell layers that surround the central meiocytes. The tapetal cell layer is the innermost somatic cell layer and the tapetum provides crucial support to the meiocyte through pollen maturation. To support meiocyte and pollen development tapetal cells become binucleate, secretory, and finally undergo programed cell death. A hierarchy of four basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TF), Male Sterile(MS) 23, MS32, bHLH122, and bHLH51 regulate tapetal cell differentiation and development. Mutants in any one of these bHLH TFs results in complete male sterility due to a failure of the tapetal cell layer to fully differentiate. Ms23, Ms32, and bhlh122 act upstream of and are required to produce 24-nt pre-meiotic phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) and bHLH51 integrates into this regulation hierarchy downstream of 24-PHAS loci activation. Here we test if the male sterile phenotype of bHLH122 and bHLH51 CRISPR knock out alleles is complemented by epitope tagged copies of these genes. These lines will allow for future molecular work to define the gene regulatory networks of bHLH122 and bHLH51.

## Abstract

Plant mechanics is influenced by external dynamic forces interacting with internal forces from developing architectures. However, the mechanisms by which plants adjust their mechanics to adapt to these forces is unknown. To quantify changes in biomechanics over lifespans, we measured stalk flexural stiffness in B73 and Mo17 plants from the vegetative tasseling (VT) stage until reproductive maturity (11 weeks total testing). Our results show that B73 plants are stronger than Mo17 plants over their lifespan. Stalk flexural stiffness is determined by the geometry and material properties of stalks. To account for changes in stalk geometry, we normalized the flexural stiffness by diameter weekly. B73 plants were still stronger than Mo17 plants after normalization. This suggests that the difference in lifespan stalk flexural stiffness between Mo17 and B73 plants may be driven by material properties. We hypothesized that changes in material properties result from the differences in developing plant architectures. To test this hypothesis, we altered plant architecture by either detasseling or replacing tassels with prosthetic tassels at the VT stage. Our results show that Mo17 plants with prosthetic tassels are stronger than Mo17 plants with intact tassels, but neither were different from Mo17 detasseled plants. In contrast, B73 plants with prosthetic tassels were not significantly different from B73 plants with intact tassels but both were stronger than B73 detasseled plants. The influence of architectural alterations is unchanged after normalizing by diameter, thus supporting our hypothesis that material properties are influenced by developing architectures. Together, these findings provide a basis for further investigating the interaction between plant architectures, material properties, and changes in stalk mechanics.

## Abstract

Brace roots, a type of adventitious root, contribute to root lodging resistance in many plants, including Zea mays. The main stages of brace root development (initiation, elongation, and maturation) are understood; however, it is unknown which nodal cells begin the development process. We developed a lineage tracing tool to address this unknown; lineage tracing marks a progenitor cell and enables its progeny to be tracked. Using Golden Gate restriction enzyme cloning, a two-construct lineage tracing system was developed. One construct carries a CRE recombinase fused to a Cyclin B1 dBox, which is expressed under a heat shock-inducible promoter and only functional in mitotically active cells. The other construct contains a ubiquitous promoter driving a floxed terminator and 3xYFP. In a cell containing both components, heat shock induces CRE-dBox expression. CRE then recognizes the loxP sites in the second component and excises the terminator between 3xYFP and the promoter. This allows 3xYFP to be expressed, permanently marking that cell and all of its progeny. These constructs are being transformed into maize, and the transformed lines will be used to determine which nodal cells give rise to brace root primordia. Ultimately, this work aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind the initiation of brace root development and investigate biomechanical resistance to root lodging. An understanding of these phenomena could aid the design of root lodging-resistant crops. Root lodging-resistant crops could efficiently increase yield on currently available agricultural land, providing food to meet the demands of the continuously growing human population while minimizing agricultural land use.

## Abstract

Seed production in Zea mays (maize) is challenged by the inherent short lifespan of maize pollen. We developed a pollen storage technology that preserves maize pollen viability for up to seven days that delivers seed set equivalency to fresh pollen. This technology is simple and scalable for use cases ranging from single plant pollinations to hectares of commercial hybrid seed production. The protocol is based on key discoveries around regulating the respiration rate of metabolically active pollen during storage, optimization of the storage environment using low-cost, globally available materials, and furthered understanding of how small particles may interfere with pollen-silk interactions. Prior efforts in maize pollen storage focused on pollen conditioning and cryogenic preservation at the expense of technology scalability. We have broken down these accessibility barriers and increased protocol repeatability through an approach that places freshly collected pollen directly in a refrigerated storage environment where pollen is free to maintain cellular respiration using atmospheric air. Historical maize pollen storage technologies have prescribed foliated mineral powders or fluffy, amorphous silicates as anti-clumping agents to prevent pollens from sticking together during storage. Scanning electron microscopy and aniline blue staining suggests that this historical precedent was a key factor limiting the pollination performance of maize pollen through inhibition of pollen-silk interaction. This led to the discovery that crystalline materials with low specific surface area and the optimal range of particle sizes deliver a step change in seed set that can be achieved with stored pollen. This technology is to be published for the greater benefit the global maize biology and production community.

## Abstract

Perennial plants regrow for multiple years and perennial crops are sustainable agriculture systems. However, breeding perennial maize has been largely unsuccessful due to our poor understanding of genes and developmental mechanisms that control perenniality. The teosinte species Zea diploperennis is perennial and forms fertile hybrids when crossed with maize. Using Z. diploperennis/maize mapping populations, perennial regrowth was mapped to three dominant loci called Regrowth1 (Reg1), Reg2, and Reg3 on chromosomes 2, 7, and 8, respectively. By analyzing individuals that displayed regrowth at early and late time points in the perennial life cycle, we determined that Reg1 affects initial regrowth while Reg3 is necessary for multiple sustained cycles of perennial regrowth. Perenniality is a complex trait thought to involve the convergence of many loci that independently affect phenology, physiology, and meristem traits. We measured several traits in introgressed populations that were segregating Reg1 and Reg3 and determined that Z. diploperennis alleles of Reg1 and Reg3 significantly delay flowering time, Reg3 instills stay-green, and neither locus influences tiller number. We collected axillary meristems (AMs) and leaf tips of WT, Reg1, Reg3, and Reg1 Reg3 individuals at around the V10 stage for RNA-seq analysis. This will help us determine which developmental pathways are differentially regulated between annuals and perennials, and may reveal the genes that underly Reg1 and Reg3. We also plan to study the developmental mechanisms that dictate perennial regrowth in Z. diploperennis, and how they differ between perennial and annual grass species. We hypothesize that: (1) the maintenance of Z. diploperennis tiller buds in a juvenile and non-flowering state is necessary for perennial regrowth; and (2) dormant tiller buds become reactivated through phytohormone or carbohydrate signaling after flowering to begin the next cycle of perennial growth. Understanding the developmental genetics of perenniality could aid in breeding of more sustainable crops.

## Abstract

The blade-sheath boundary (BSB) of the maize leaf comprises two distinct tissues, an epidermally-derived ligule and a hinge-like auricle, that demarcate the distal blade and proximal sheath identities. The recessive mutation liguleless1(lg1) deletes the ligule and auricle and thus provides a useful genetic tool for identification of genetic networks controlling BSB development. WOX3 family double mutants narrow sheath1; narrow sheath2 (ns1/2) delete the marginal domain leaving blunt leaf edges, whereas higher order WOX3 triple mutants (ns1 ns2 wox3a) delete the lateral and marginal domains and cause severe ligule/auricle defects. Class I KNOX family genes function antagonistically with WOX3 function during recruitment of leaf founder cells, and the KNOX gene LIGULELESS3 is expressed early in BSB development. Previous transcriptomic analyses of initiating ligules identified overlapping expression patterns for LG1, WOX3 family genes, and class I KNOX genes in the incipient BSB. In addition, lg1 mutants form ectopic sheath margin tissue that extends into the blade asymmetrically, implicating interactive LG1, WOX3, and KNOX function during proximodistal and mediolateral patterning. Although transcriptional analyses have been conducted on initiating maize ligules, the genetic mechanisms of later-staged BSB development are unknown. Here, we utilize single-cell transcriptomics to examine multiple stages of ligule/auricle outgrowth and patterning. Additionally, lg1 ns1 ns2 triple mutants condition surprising and synergistic phenotypes. In situ hybridizations support a model wherein the coordination of interactive LG1, WOX3, and class I KNOXes gene functions patterns robust proximodistal and mediolateral development. Previous attempts to generate maize WOX3 and LG1 fluorescent reporter-protein (FP) lines were unsuccessful, likely owing to complexities in maize promotor structures. Recently, mutants and FP lines of LG1, NS1/2, and WOX3a orthologous genes were generated in the grass model Brachypodium distachyon, to investigate the dynamic interactions of these transcription factors during proximodistal and mediolateral leaf development.

## Abstract

Maize TERMINAL EAR 1 (TE1) encodes a predicted RNA-binding protein containing three conserved RNA recognition motifs. Loss-of-function mutants have pleiotropic developmental defects, including faster leaf initiation, altered phyllotaxy, dwarf stature, and a feminized tassel. Despite controlling various aspects of maize development, the mechanism of TE1 action is poorly understood. RNA-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-Seq) using TE1-Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-expressing maize ear primordia revealed TE1 binding to mRNAs of multiple maize developmental genes, including SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE genes TASSELSHEATH4, UNBRANCHED2, and UNBRANCHED3. However, mRNA-Seq analysis of te1 mutants did not identify a significant change in the levels of most candidate TE1-bound target mRNAs. In contrast, the proteins encoded by candidate TE1-bound mRNAs were more abundant in te1 mutants, suggesting TE1 may control its targets at a post-transcriptional level. We also identified TE1-YFP interacting proteins using proteomics, and Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment in stress granule assembly and regulation of translation categories. Consistent with this, a functional TE1-YFP fusion localized to cytoplasmic puncta. These puncta accumulate and enlarge following heat shock and co-localize with a stress granule marker. To ask if TE1 functions in heat stress responses, we tested germination following heat treatments, and found that te1 mutants were more sensitive to heat stress. Our results suggest that TE1 binding to developmental mRNAs and sequestering them in cytoplasmic granules may be part of a mechanism to negatively regulate plant development. Thus, we hypothesize that TE1 may function to control the important tradeoff between plant growth and stress responses. Further understanding of TE1 function could provide new insights to enhance sustainable food production and ensure food security in the face of a changing climate.

## Abstract

Based on DNA nucleases, the first generation of CRISPR gene-editing tools create cuts in DNA and mutations from error-prone DNA repair. The resulting insertions or deletions most commonly lead to a recessive loss of gene function through a translation frame shift, disrupting a protein domain, or decreasing gene expression level. These types of mutations are typically recessive and will continue to be valuable to geneticists for assigning gene function. However, there are serious technical difficulties deploying recessive mutations for commercial crop improvement. Most genes are part of gene families with some degree of functional redundancy. Genetic redundancy is an even greater issue in polyploid genomes which are common in crop species. Because clonal crops like fruit trees and berries do not breed true and cannot be reproduced through self pollination without major changes in desired agronomic traits, they pose a particular challenge when using recessive gene edits as deployment would require efficient simultaneous editing of multiple gene copies in the clonal plant. Finally, an increasing number of crops, following from maize, are grown as F1 hybrids because of improved yield, uniformity, and seed IP protection. Engineering recessive loss-of-function in hybrid crops necessitates introduction of the gene edit into both hybrid parents which adds considerable cost, complexity, and regulatory hurdles. The difficulties with deploying recessive loss-of-function editing strategies in crops necessitates a different genetic approach, engineered genetic dominance. Unfortunately, examples of dominant mutations are relatively rare in mutant collections, despite dominant mutations being integral to plant evolutionary transitions and agricultural innovation. Here we show methods of improving maize yield component traits with genetically dominant gene edits. Specifically, we show that dominance can be deployed with large chromosomal rearrangements, targeted domain deletion, gene inversion, and releasing mechanisms of transcriptional and translational inhibition.

## Abstract

Accurate recognition and removal of introns from precursor mRNA by spliceosome is a fundamental but complex process essential for the expression of eukaryotic genes. In addition to the major group, most eukaryotic organisms contain a rare minor group of introns called U12-type. Minor introns constitute less than 0.5% of all introns and are spliced by a separate minor spliceosome. The parallel existence of two groups of introns and their biological relevance is unclear; however, mutations that disrupt the splicing of U12-type introns cause developmental defects in plants and animals. Our laboratory recently reported a conserved RNA Binding Motif Protein 48 (RBM48) gene required for splicing U12-type introns and encoding a core minor spliceosomal protein. A maize rbm48 mutant displays genome-wide disruption of primarily U12-type introns with a severe defect in kernel development. Intriguingly, the maize and human RBM48 encode several transcript isoforms by alternative splicing; however, the biological function of transcript isoforms in U12 splicing is not apparent. In this report, we have developed a genetic assay by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the RBM48 gene in the human cancer-derived cell line K562 to investigate the biological function of RBM transcript isoforms. Using RT-PCR with primers flanking the U12-type introns, we demonstrate they are not efficiently spliced in RBM48 knockout (KO) K562 cells. We also show that by separately transfecting the wild type and three different alternatively spliced transcript isoforms of RBM48 in the mutant K562 cells, the splicing of U12-type introns can be restored or genetically complemented. This provides evidence for the important role of RBM48 transcript isoforms in U12 splicing. The data generated from these studies will be presented.

## Abstract

Root systems perform multiple functions for plants, including anchorage and nutrient uptake. Past work has studied the trade-off between brace root mechanics and nitrogen uptake and it was found that bigger brace roots take up more nitrogen. Previous unpublished research also found that aerial brace and soil brace roots take up different amounts of nitrogen. It is hypothesized that this anomaly is caused by the differential expression of nitrogen transporters in brace roots. To test this hypothesis, RNA from previously collected brace root samples from five different genotypes was used to perform RT-qPCR, using primers for seven different nitrogen transporters, to determine how much of each nitrogen transporter is expressed in each brace root. Preliminary results show that some genes are differentially expressed between aerial brace roots and terrestrial brace roots. Additionally, five nitrogen transporter maize mutants were grown and phenotyped. Nitrogen uptake assays were performed on the aerial and soil brace roots to determine if the mutation affects the plant’s ability to take up nitrogen and the plant’s preference for nitrogen type. Bend tests were also performed on aerial and soil brace roots for each plant, and additional samples were taken for RT-qPCR. Mechanical data from the bend tests will be compared to the nitrogen uptake data to further understand the tradeoff, or lack thereof, between brace root mechanics and nitrogen uptake.

## Abstract

The efficiency of solar radiation interception contributes to the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants. Light interception is a function of canopy architecture, including, plant density, leaf number, length, width, and angle, as well as azimuthal canopy orientation. We report on the ability of some maize genotypes to alter the orientations of their leaves during development in coordination with adjacent plants. Although the upper canopies of these genotypes retain the typical alternate-distichous phyllotaxy of maize, their leaves grow parallel to those of adjacent plants. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on this parallel canopy trait identified candidate genes, many of which are associated with shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), including phytochromeC2 (phyC2). GWAS conducted on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by canopies also identified multiple candidate genes, including liguleless1 (lg1), previously defined by its role in ligule development. Under high plant densities mutant of SAS and liguleless genes (lg1, lg2 and Lg3) exhibit altered canopy patterns, viz., the numbers of interrow leaves are greatly reduced as compared to non-mutant controls, resulting in dramatically decreased PAR interception. In at least the case of lg2, this phenotype is not a consequence of abnormal ligule development. Instead, liguleless gene functions are required for normal light responses, including azimuth canopy re-orientation.

## Abstract

In grasses, inflorescence architecture impacts grain yield and harvestability. The degree of inflorescence branching and position of grain and pollen-bearing spikelets are determined by timing of spikelet meristem (SM) identity, where an indeterminate branch meristem acquires a determinate fate to initiate spikelet development. In maize, mutants impaired in axillary meristem determinacy or identity, e.g., ramosa mutants, have increased branching in tassels and ears, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.Here, we use model grass Setaria viridis to dissect the mechanisms underlying SM identity and determinacy. Setaria’s unique inflorescence morphology offers an ideal system for this study; axillary branches terminate either in a spikelet or sterile bristle, the latter due to an imposed fate overriding SM identity. Using a mutagenesis screen, we isolated a spectrum of meristem identity mutants. Among these, bristleless1 (bsl1) and spikeletless (spkl) displayed homeotic conversions from bristles to spikelets or spikelets to bristles, respectively. Genetic mapping indicated that brassinosteroids (BRs) and gibberellic acid (GA) were intimately involved in the spikelet vs bristle fate decision, and treatment with exogenous GA or BR inhibitor produced inflorescences with all bristles or spikelets, respectively. bsl1 is defective in the ortholog of rice D11, a rate-limiting enzyme in BR biosynthesis, and we validated spkl as an ortholog of maize ramosa1 (ra1). Genetic analyses in Setaria indicate that bsl1 is epistatic to spkl and we propose a model where SPKL/RA1 regulates SM identity genes through interfacing with BR and GA pathways. We also isolated a mutant in maize d11 (Zmd11), which had semi-dwarf stature and smaller tassels with fewer branches. Crossing Zmd11 to the ra1-R allele suggested more complex genetic interactions underlying inflorescence phenotypes in maize. Our results highlight conservation and divergence of pathways governing SM fate between Setaria and maize, knowledge that can be harnessed for development of higher yielding cereals.

## Abstract

For a successful double fertilization process in flowering plants (angiosperms), pollen tubes each deliver two non-motile sperm cells towards female gametes (egg and central cell, respectively). Heatwaves especially during the reproduction period are threatening male gametophyte (pollen) development, which results in severe yield losses. By using maize as a crop and grass model system, we found strong seed set reduction when moderate heat stress was applied for two days during the uni- and bicellular stages of pollen development. We show that heat stress accelerates pollen development and impairs pollen germination capabilities, when applied at the unicellular stage. Heat stress at the bicellular stage impairs sperm cell development and their transport into pollen tubes. To understand the course of the latter defects, we used marker lines and analyzed the transcriptomes of isolated sperm cells. While heat stress also affects the expression of genes involved in transcription, RNA processing and translation, especially genes in DNA replication and the cell cycle were mis-regulated. This includes centromeric histone CENH3 and α-tubulin. Most mis-regulated genes are involved in transition from metaphase to anaphase during pollen mitosis II (PM II). Heat stress activates spindle assembly check point and meta- to anaphase transition genes in sperm cells. In summary, mis-regulation of the identified genes during heat stress at the bicellular stage explains sperm cell development and transport defects ultimately leading to sterility.

## Abstract

The reproductive phase in flowering plants is highly sensitive to ambient temperature stresses, with even a single hot day sometimes being fatal to reproductive success. Many studies of heat stress on crop plants have shown that pollen development and fertilization belong to the most sensitive reproductive stages. To study the sensitivity and contribution of the elongated stigma tissue of maize (silks) to reproduction under heat stress, we applied moderate heat stress before pollination and during pollen tube growth. We will show that moderate heat stress causes late growth arrest of pollen tubes ultimately leading to sterility. We further show that heat stress causes elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be reduced by scavengers partly restoring pollen tube growth defects. Heat stressed silks show that among others hydrogen peroxide catabolic processes and bHLH transcription factor genes are downregulated, while NAC and other transcription factor genes are strongly upregulated. To further push the development of stress resistant/tolerant maize and to select genes for functional studies, we generated a transcriptomic and proteomic atlas of maize at various environmental conditions and over time. We applied three major abiotic stresses (cold, heat and drought) to seedlings over a period of ten days and generated a database and web interface named MaizeStressDB. Functional differentially expressed genes and proteins (DEGs and DEPs) as well as gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can be identified in the web browser and associated with core regulators in response to cold, heat and drought stress. The MaizeStressDB platform will now help to drive the development of maize varieties better adapted to transient heat stress during the reproductive phase.

## Abstract

The production of doubled haploid plants is a valuable process in the toolbox of the modern plant breeder; however, chromosomal doubling achieved via contact with doubling agents e.g., colchicine, is highly stressful and often lethal to young plants. We sought to test whether herbicide safener compounds could improve the survival rate of in vitro culture maize embryos when contacted with the doubling agent colchicine. In our method, we supplemented the doubling media with the herbicide safener, Metcamifen, at varying concentrations from 200 g/L- 800 g/L. We extracted maize embryos from a variety of lines and advanced the putative haploid embryos to germination media. The healthy seedlings were then transferred to soil, grown to maturity, and self-pollinated under optimal glasshouse conditions. We report a significant increase in the survival rate of putative haploid maize embryos following our optimized protocol, and a significant increase in the return rate of doubled haploid seed relative to the control. This innovation substantially increases the efficiency of obtaining sufficient numbers of doubled haploid plants and thus enables breeders to better leverage the power of doubled haploid plants in their breeding programs.

## Abstract

Maize root systems exhibit plastic phenotypes that are constrained by genotype. An outstanding question in the field is whether juvenile traits under controlled environments, such as hormone responses, can predict mature crown root phenotypes under field conditions. Previously, the Kelley lab has studied the response of 10-day-old maize seedlings to exogenous auxin in 617 genotypes from the Wisconsin Diversity panel. While reference genotypes such as B73 and W22 exhibit primary root inhibition following auxin treatment, numerous genotypes were auxin hypersensitive or insensitive. These ~20 genotypes were grown in the field and subsequently phenotyped to identify any adult crown root traits that could be indicative of the genotype’s early auxin response. Some of the features were examined include root angle, surface area, and average root length. Manual phenotyping can lead to errors and bias, so a digital pipeline was designed using ImageJ, Root painter, and Rhizovision. Statistical analysis was performed across the genotypes to explore relationships between different phenotypic traits relative to B73. As analysis continues, we hope to find traits that are indicative of auxin response. In turn we also hope to predict certain adult phenotypes through the seedling auxin response.

## Abstract

Plant architecture is a key determinant of grain yield in maize. Among the major plant growth regulators, brassinosteroids (BRs) affect multiple plant architecture traits, including organ size, sex determination, and leaf angle. However, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have characterized several BR biosynthesis and signaling mutants that emphasize the role of BRs in plant growth and development. We generated a mutant brassinosteroid deficient semi-dwarf (bds1) as a nonsense mutation in BR biosynthetic putative gene. We also identified the close homolog bds2 and generated several mutant alleles by Ds transposon remobilization. Unlike bds1 mutants, bds2 single mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type plants. However, bds1-R;bds2-Ds double mutants exhibited enhanced developmental defects such as dwarfing and tassel feminization. We have also identified and characterized mutants of cabbage (cbg1 and cbg2) BR biosynthetic genes from UFMu lines. Neither single mutant displayed obvious defects. However, cbg1;cbg2 double mutants had extreme dwarf stature, smaller leaves, fewer tassel branches and reduced root growth. Thus, we hypothesize that these genes redundantly function to regulate plant development. We also investigated roles of brassinosteroid insensitive1 (bri1) genes, which encode a receptor-like kinase serving as the BR receptor. Maize encodes five BRI1 members: a specific duplication of BRI1 (ZmBRI1a and ZmBRI1b), and three additional homologs (BRL1, BRL2, and BRL3). To understand the tissue-specific functions of the individual receptors and their contributions to BR signaling, we have identified Mutator or Ac/Ds transposon mutants for all genes and stacked various receptor mutants to examine the 32 single, double, triple, quadruple, and quintuple mutants. In seedling shoots and roots we observed developmental defects across different genotypes. No genotypes with a functional bri1a or bri1b showed obvious growth defects. However, bri1a;bri1b double mutants exhibited extreme dwarfing and reduced root size, indicating functional redundancy. Plant growth defects were enhanced in specific higher order mutant combinations such as bri1a;bri1b;brl1 triples and bri1a;bri1b;brl1;brl3 quadruples, implying some tissue specificity.

## Abstract

Plant meristems serve as a center for growth; they house stem cells that both self-renew and provide cells for organogenesis. All plant cells, including meristematic cells, are surrounded by rigid cell walls, a complex polysaccharide matrix that must be remodeled when cells expand and divide. Most plants have Type I cell walls, which have relatively high levels of pectin. In contrast, maize and other grasses have Type II cell walls, with significantly lower levels of pectin and a greater abundance and variety of hemicelluloses. Despite the importance of meristems and the cell wall in regulating plant growth, relatively little is known about how the cell wall is integrated with meristem function, although pectin is emerging as a key component in Type I plant cell walls. For example, in Arabidopsis, de-methylesterification of pectin is required to increase cell wall extensibility and promote primordia outgrowth. The role of pectin in plants with Type II cell walls, including maize, is much less clear. Maize contains multiple meristem types that vary in determinacy, phyllotaxy and primordia identity, and thus is an excellent system to investigate the links between the cell wall and meristem function. We first investigated the role of pectin in maize floral meristems using three monoclonal antibodies that recognize specific pectic epitopes. Interestingly, pectin accumulates differently in the upper and lower florets. In the upper floret, de-methylesterified pectin accumulated in initiating organ primordia, similar to Arabidopsis, whereas methylesterified pectin accumulated on the apical surface of the meristem. In contrast, little staining for either epitope was observed in the lower floret. We also examined the localization of a specific epitope of another pectin, rhamnogalacturonan-I, which interestingly, accumulated specifically at the boundary between the upper and lower floret. To further understand the role of pectin in meristems, we are examining the localization of these three pectic epitopes in other inflorescence meristem types, in vegetative shoot meristems, and in developmental mutants that alter meristem activity. Indeed, pectin accumulation is altered in bearded-ear mutants, which have defects in floral meristem determinacy and identity. Our results suggest that despite its low abundance in Type II cell walls, pectin is remarkably dynamic during maize development and may contribute to meristem growth dynamics.

## Abstract

Abiotic environmental stress caused by climate change is threatening agricultural systems by inhibiting plant growth and development. Metabolite signaling regulates both stress response and development in plants, however, critical metabolite-driven links between development and stress response remain an open area of exploration. To investigate the link between development and stress response, longitudinal sections of maize roots were imaged using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy imaging (DESI-MSI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MSI. These high-resolution imaging techniques enable visualization of the localization of stress-induced metabolites across the developmental gradient in roots. Many of the metabolites that we have identified are uncharacterized, we are using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS/MS to determine the chemical composition of these small molecules. We have also identified several known meristem-localized metabolites, including succinate, with differential localization in response to stress. Exogenous treatments with these metabolites show significant growth phenotypes during stress. The spatial identification of stress-responsive metabolites with MSI will reveal candidate metabolites that bridge stress response and development. Characterizing the biological effect of these metabolites, through a combination of chemical and genetic screens, will provide insights into the mechanisms that plants utilize to address abiotic stress in an effort to generate more stress-tolerant crop lines.

## Abstract

In maize leaves, the distal blade projects away from the plant whereas the proximal sheath surrounds and supports the underlying stem. The orientation of the inner and outer edges of the overlapping sheath margins show robust, non-random patterning. Specifically, the outermost edge wraps around the innermost edge to form consistent, left margin/right margin "wrapper-tucker" pattern (W-T) persistent across plastochron stages. In situ hybridizations of the boundary gene CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) reveal asymmetric transcript accumulation in the wrapper and tucker edges of the emerging sheath primordial margins, suggesting a potential role for CUC2 in the establishment and maintenance of the W-T pattern. In specific combinations of higher-order mutations in WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX3 (WOX3) genes, W-T patterning is random and robustness is lost. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying W-T patterning in grass leaves, we are conducting laser microdissection RNA-seq (LM-RNAseq) analyses of the marginal domains of emerging P4 leaf sheath primordia. Other higher-order mutations in WOX3 genes condition defects in tassel spikelet morphology, particularly influencing the bract-like glumes. In the "very narrow sheath (vns; i.e. ns1 ns2 WOX3A+/wox3a") mutant, glumes are significantly narrowed, creating an open spikelet that exposes the stamens before anthesis. Conversely, wox3 triple mutants (ns1 ns2 wox3a) displays distinctively forked glumes that split at the end. Both the vns and wox3 triple mutant phenotypes demonstrate a tendency toward feminization, notably evident in spikelets at the distal tip of the primary tassel branch. LM-RNAseq and spatial transcriptomic analyses will be used to elucidate the developmental mechanisms of WOX3 function in maize leaf and floral development.

## Abstract

Increasing ploidy levels in plant species has been shown to increase cell size. The benefits of increasing cell size have been used in crops such as potato and sugarcane to produce larger yields. In maize, increasing ploidy results in increased grain size but not yield, which has limited its usefulness. However, increasing ploidy can potentially be employed for bioenergy crops where seed yield is not the primary target. Current efforts to produce ethanol from sorghum stem sugars for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market are not economically feasible, driving the need to increase sorghum’s sugar production. A potential solution is to increase the ploidy level in sorghum to create bigger cells that can store more juice and sugar in the stem. A colchicine-induced autotetraploid sorghum and its progeny were validated using flow cytometry. Diploid and M2 generation autotetraploid plants were grown in both the field and greenhouse for characterization. Autotetraploid plants had stomata that were 1.5x larger than diploids, leading to differences in stomatal density. Leaf gas exchange was measured using a Li-6800 to assess differences in net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, and transpiration efficiency. No significant differences between ploidy levels were observed for any gas exchange parameters. In field grown trials, both diploid and autotetraploid sorghum were juiced to measure biomass, sugar concentration (brix), and juice volume to determine sugar storing properties. Total biomass, juice volume, and brix were all significantly higher in diploids, while percent sugar per dry weight and total sugars were not significantly different. The lower values observed in the autotetraploid were not unexpected given previous reports on the performance of inbred autotetraploid lines. We hypothesize that generating double-cross hybrid autotetraploid lines will result in increased vigor through progressive heterosis. Currently, autotetraploid sorghum hybrids are being generated to explore the potential of a double-cross hybrid sorghum.

## Abstract

Approximately 90 million acres are devoted to the cultivation of maize in the United States. which is crucial for sustaining various industries. This process, integral for a stable supply of essential products, emphasizes the need for Cresearch to enhance each stage of maize cultivation. A key aspect involves understanding the role of zeins in maize development; during endosperm maturation, an increase in zein production provides nutrition for the embryo during germination. Our goal is to classify and comprehend gene expression patterns in maize endosperm, shedding light on the intricate processes regulating its development.K-means clustering is used to organize data into groups/clusters based on similarities. By using K-means clustering on maize endosperm expression data, we can reveal various expression patterns over time and uncover the molecular events that coordinate endosperm development.The objective of this study is to identify clusters of co-expressed genes, aiming to uncover patterns present during the crucial stages of maize endosperm development. For example, we may observe potential gene regulators based on a rise in expression just before the gene(s) of interest become more highly expressed. Initial results revealed patterns of gene expression during development. We identified groups with timepoint-specific expression patterns with peak expression occurring at early, middle, and late points in endosperm development. Other clusters showed groups of genes that were expressed consistently throughout development. These findings may pave a path for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying endosperm development and offer potential targets for further investigation.Moving forward, this project is part of a broader time point analysis of endosperm expression. This research aims to contribute insights into gene regulatory networks during the intricate process of endosperm development to explore gene expression patterns across various time points in reciprocal crosses of two maize cultivars.

## Abstract

Microtubule dynamics and organization influence cell shape and cell division plane orientation. One protein complex involved in this process is KATANIN, a microtubule severing AAA ATPase hexameric complex composed of catalytic p60 and regulatory WD-40-containing p80 subunits. The p60 catalytic subunit forms hexamers and is sufficient to sever microtubules through ATP hydrolysis. However, binding of the protein complex to microtubule severing sites is mediated by the p80 subunit, allowing for higher severing efficiency of microtubules. In Zea mays (maize), several katanin (p60) mutants have been identified, including a loss-of-function double mutant, discordia3a-2 discordia3b (dcd3a-2 dcd3b), and a semi-dominant mutant, Clumped tassel 1 (Clt1), which may have disrupted ATP hydrolysis. To determine how these mutations influence KATANIN’s microtubule severing function, in vivo microtubule severing was assessed. Results show reduced microtubule severing frequency in dcd3a-2 dcd3b and homozygous Clt1 mutant plants, though not a total loss, suggesting other microtubule severing proteins may be functional in maize. dcd3a-2 dcd3b and Clt1 mutants have shorter stature and less elongated cells than their wild-type siblings. Abnormal cell division positioning was observed in dcd3a-2 dcd3b double mutant cells, primarily in asymmetrically dividing cells. Time-lapse imaging of dcd3a-2 dcd3b plants expressing a microtubule marker will pinpoint when asymmetric cell divisions go awry. Characterizing KATANIN function in maize will lead to a greater understanding of the impacts of microtubule dynamics and organization on plant growth and development.

## Abstract

Stem cells are a rare population of cells in plant shoots that produce leaves, fruits and seeds, vital sources for food and bioethanol. Uncovering regulators expressed in these stem cells will inform crop engineering to boost productivity. Single-cell analysis is a powerful tool for identifying regulators expressed in specific groups of cells. However, accessing plant shoot stem cells is challenging. Recent single-cell analyses of plant shoots have not captured these cells, and failed to detect stem cell regulators like CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL. In this study, we finely dissected stem cell-enriched shoot tissues from both maize and arabidopsis for single-cell RNA-seq profiling. We used an optimized protocol to efficiently recover thousands of CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL expressed cells. A cross-species comparison identified conserved stem cell regulators between maize and arabidopsis. We also performed single-cell RNA-seq on stem cell overproliferation mutants in maize to find additional candidate regulators. Expression of candidate stem cell regulators was validated using spatial transcriptomics, and we functionally confirmed roles in shoot development. These candidates include a family of ribosome-associated RNA-binding proteins, and two families of sugar kinase genes related to hypoxia signaling and cytokinin hormone homeostasis. Our cross-species stem cell profiling provides a resource for mining stem cell regulators, advances understanding of shoot development, and opens avenues for manipulating diverse crops to enhance food and energy security.

## Abstract

Nodal roots form the main root systems of a mature maize plant. Nodal roots consist of two types; crown roots that originate from below-ground nodes and brace roots from aboveground nodes. While previous research emphasizes the vital role of brace roots in providing stability and resistance to lodging, the specific impact of altering brace root development on other essential root functions remains unexplored. To investigate this, we first conducted RNA sequencing on stem nodes at various stages of brace root development to identify candidate genes. Our analysis identified SBP transcription factors among the differentially expressed genes. We show that SBP mutants such as unbranched 2 (ub2) unbranched 3 (ub3) and tasselsheath4 (tsh4) exhibit diverse brace root phenotypes, including variations in the number of roots per whorl, the number of whorls penetrating the soil, and brace root diameter. In addition, anchorage and nitrogen uptake capabilities were altered in these lines as well as in the dominant Corngrass1 (Cg1) mutant that overexpresses miR156 which targets SBP genes. Our results show that early in development when the contribution of brace roots to anchorage is minimal, root torsional stiffness is similar across different genotypes. Later, however, when brace root contributions are significant, mutants with smaller brace root diameters had reduced root torsional stiffness, while those with larger diameters were increased. Furthermore, Cg1 mutant brace roots took up more N15-labeled nitrogen than the wild-type, without showing preference for specific nitrogen types. Together, these data demonstrate that SBP genes impact brace root, anchorage, stiffness, and adsorption, functions that were not previously associated with these genes.

## Abstract

The hormone ethylene plays a key role in plant development where it acts largely to inhibit growth. Ethylene is also a pivotal stress signal. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge regarding ethylene’s roles in Arabidopsis, our understanding of its function in cereal crops is markedly limited. Here, we characterize mutations in maize ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3(EIN3)-LIKE1 (ZmEIL1) and ZmEIL9 genes that encode co-orthologs of the Arabidopsis EIN3/EIL1 transcription factors. By stacking independently derived mutations in ZmEIL1 and ZmEIL9, we uncovered vegetative shoot phenotypes associated with mis-regulated growth that are distinct from Arabidopsis ein3;eil1 mutants. Zmeil1;Zmeil9 double mutants are insensitive to the ethylene precursor ACC in growth assays. We utilized single-cell transcriptomics to identify tissue- and cell-specific genetic signatures in Zmeil1;Zmeil9 and normal shoots with and without ACC. Transcripts of genes in hormone pathways and of genes involved in growth regulation differentially accumulate in various cell clusters between genotype and treatment conditions. We leveraged DNA Affinity Purification sequencing to identify genome-wide binding positions of ZmEILs. We found that many ZmEIL1 and ZmEIL9 binding sites overlap, suggesting co-regulation of a portion of putative target loci, including a proportion of genes that were identified as differentially expressed in our single-cell data. Our study shows that ZmEIL genes are central regulators of shoot growth and, by uncovering tissue-specific responses of the ethylene pathway, provides novel insights into our understanding of ethylene signaling in plants.

## Abstract

Regular patterned leaf initiation at the shoot apical meristem (SAM), or phyllotaxy, determines a plant’s arrangement of leaves around a stem. In maize phyllotaxy, leaves are initiated successively on alternating sides of the plant, offset by 180˚. Among all plants, few mutants have been identified that influence phyllotaxy, suggesting the process is robust and functionally buffered. In maize, mutants for the aberrant phyllotaxy1 (abph1) cytokinin signaling gene have altered phyllotaxy wherein leaves are instead initiated on opposite sides of the plant in pairs offset by 90˚. abph1 mutants have an enlarged SAM which is proposed to result from complex interactions between the hormones cytokinin and auxin. We have identified transcription factor (TF) genes ereb130, ereb184 and paralogs whose mutants result in altered phyllotaxy reminiscent of abph1. These TF mutants have relatively high penetrance in standard inbred lines in which abph1 mutants are nearly normal. Expression analysis of ereb130 mutants indicates a potential reduction in the biosynthesis of auxin, a hormone necessary for leaf initiation. Meristem size is unaffected in the inbred single mutants examined, yet the double mutants ereb130; ereb184 or ereb130;abph1 show similarly enlarged SAMs. Both double mutants show an increase in the total number of leaves initiated, yet this interaction is additive in ereb double mutants and synergistic in combination with abph1. These mutants allow for further elucidation and integration of hormones, gene expression, and morphology in the regulatory network controlling phyllotaxy. To further explore this, RNA-seq data from these various mutants is being combined with DAP-seq data for the EREB TFs to determine shared or independent changes in expression dynamics among these mutants that relate to the phyllotactic phenotypes. Given variation in SAM size and expression patterns among maize inbred lines, these mutants open a door to explore how diverse inbreds might differentially modulate leaf initiation.

## Abstract

The plant vascular system is a complex network which connects all organs. In maize leaves, the midvein, primary lateral, intermediate, and small veins are developed parallel to the direction of growth. Transverse veins, on the other hand, grow perpendicular to the other vein types, and therefore interconnect the entire leaf vascular system. We used a combination of plant anatomy tools and hormone reporters to observe the morphology and cellular development of transverse veins. A combination of diagnostic stains demonstrate that transverse veins may form between all parallel vein classes (midvein, lateral, intermediate, small), and like parallel veins, mature transverse veins consist of xylem, phloem and bundle sheath cell types. Although transverse veins may initiate connections between parallel veins which have already differentiated specialized cells, mature transverse veins display seamless connections with the bundle sheath, xylem vessel elements, and phloem sieve tubes of parallel veins, requiring cellular reorganization from these cells. Using the PIN1a-YFP marker line, early transverse vein formation is observed as single transverse anticlinal cell divisions followed by high PIN1a-YFP expression within paired spots along the procambium of parallel vascular bundles, flanking an incipient transverse vein. Cells in these spots are characterized by prominent nuclei and a denser cytoplasm than observed in surrounding procambial cells. Later, PIN1a-YFP is observed in a small file of cells that converges bidirectionally inward, derived from anticlinal divisions within leaf ground tissue cells. Our evidence suggests that PIN1a-YFP appears at the same time or after the first divisions which define the transverse vein, and DR5::erRFP is not detected in these cells. In contrast to parallel vein types, we conclude auxin transport and signaling are involved after an unknown vein recruitment signal, perceived prior to ground cell division. Ongoing work uses transverse veins as an experimental system for monocot vein ontogenesis via live imaging.

## Abstract

The nucleus is the characteristic organelle that makes eukaryotic cells distinct from archaea and prokaryotes. Nucleus contains genetic materials and protects itself by double layer membrane. Like any other membrane, double layer nuclear membrane includes proteins, and they are known as nuclear membrane proteins. In a dynamic cell, the nucleus is motile, and this movement is mediated by the interaction between nuclear membrane proteins and cytoskeleton. In a recent study, I have demonstrated that if this interaction between nuclear membrane proteins and cytoskeleton is interrupted at cellular level, nucleus fails to position correctly, and the future cell division follows the altered nuclear position. This study answers a long-standing biology question: The nucleus decides the future cell division site. In careful observation, this event highlights how nuclear envelope proteins regulate cell division, more precisely future division site. Interestingly, nuclear envelope breaks down during the cell division and re-appears in the daughter cell nucleus. What happens to the nuclear membrane proteins after the envelope breaks down? What is the function of nuclear envelope proteins during mitosis? The research in my lab tries to answer these fundamental questions using the Zea mays genetic and cell biology resources.

## Abstract

Transient gene expression in plant protoplast has been used in gene functional characterization, protein subcellular localization, and protein-protein interaction. Plant protoplast isolation and transient expression methods have been reported in some plants, including Arabidopsis, tomato, apple, maize, etc. However, previous maize protoplast transformation methods were primarily done with mesophyll protoplast, or suspension-cultured cells. There is no report on protoplast transformation with maize root protoplasts. Here, we describe a PEG-mediated transformation for transient gene expression in maize root protoplasts to characterize transcription factors that may be involved in maize cuticle biosynthesis. There is limited reference data for maize root protoplast transformation, and we have tested several different transformation methods. We show that PEG-mediated transformation has the most consistent transformation efficiency and gene expression, but the transformation efficiency remains low. Our protocol provides a maize root protoplast transformation method for molecular and cellular biology research.

## Abstract

Plant breeding must be accelerated to meet the growing agricultural demands. Doubled haploid (DH) technology can accelerate plant breeding by reducing the time needed to produce inbred lines in two generations versus six or more generations with conventional breeding. The two main steps in DH technology are: haploid induction and subsequent DH production. In maize DH breeding, haploid inducers have been established and causal genes are identified. Haploid plants - intermediates between diploids and DHs - carry only one set of chromosomes leading to erroneous male meiosis I (MI) resulting in male sterility. Current protocols commonly use colchicine (a mitotic inhibitor) to mitigate the sterility to produce DH. This process is laborious, resource intensive and inefficient. Alternatively, haploid male fertility (HMF) has been observed in some maize gentoypes, barley, pummelo, rapeseed, rice, rye and wheat bread but no genes have been described. Haploid female fertility (HFF), however, is present to some extent in plants possibly involving mechanisms different from HMF. Previous research has shown that in diploid Arabidopsis mutant, Atspo11-1 or Atspo11-2, chromosomes are unequally distributed during male MI, despite the presence of two sets of chromosomes. The result is also male sterility. Mutations in two individual genes, Atps1-1 and Atjas-2 can independently correct chromosomal distribution error of diploid spo11-1. These two mutants form parallel spindles (PS) in MII instead of the perpendicular spindles in wild type. We hypothesized that Atps1-1 and Atjas-2 mutations can correct erroneous MI in haploids. Herein, we demonstrate that mutations in the ps genes is sufficient to restore HMF in Arabidopsis with no impact on HFF. These genes are conserved across plant kingdom. Putative maize candidate genes have been identified and are currently being studied for their role in HMF restoration.

## Abstract

Phytoremediation efficiency depends on the uptake mechanisms of soil contaminants by the plants. Phytoextraction is a potential alternative to diffuse the soil minerals in agriculture lands using high yielding crops, as these are expected to decontaminate the soil. Two crop plants Chenopodium quinoa and Triticum aestivum have been investigated for phytodesalination. Plants were exposed to stress at three salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 dsm -1) for 28 days and the remediation efficiency of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine was evaluated. Chenopodium quinoa, with 23.96% efficiency, showed the highest potential for sodium uptake at the highest salinity levels. The highest magnesium and chloride uptake efficiencies were 24.52% and 18.41% in Chenopodium quinoa plants at the highest salinity level. The efficiency of phytoremediation of potassium in Triticum aestivum at the highest salinity level was 5.03 ± 2.04% and in Chenopodium quinoa was 10.33 ± 2.48%. Bioaccumulation of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride was also investigated in the roots and shoots of plants. The efficiency of calcium uptake in Triticum aestivum decreased with increasing salinity levels and reached 14.97 ± 3.52%. Calcium uptake efficiency in both plants decreased with increasing salinity levels and reached 14.97 ± 3.52 and 20.85 ± 4.11%, respectively. The leaf area and dry weight of Chenopodium quinoa increased with increasing salinity levels. The highest transfer factor of 11.39 was observed in Chenopodium quinoa for calcium ions in the control sample. The results suggest that, in salinity areas, Chenopodium quinoa and Triticum aestivum should be grown alternately to improve the land reclamation, reduce salinity, and increase yields of wheat.

## Abstract

Plants possess an incredible degree of developmental plasticity and ability to regenerate. Plant regeneration can be generally achieved using tissue culture systems involving the manipulation of the hormones auxin and cytokinin. However, the ability to regenerate shoots is still a bottleneck in several plant species. Ectopic overexpression of plant morphogenic genes is a promising strategy for increasing the regeneration efficiency of recalcitrant plants, such as maize. Such morphogenic genes include the transcription factor BABYBOOM (BBM) and the transcription factor-cofactor complex GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR4-GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR1 (GRF-GIF), whose overexpression has been previously shown to improve regeneration in maize while avoiding pleiotropic effects. However, the mechanisms through which these factors promote shoot regeneration are not well understood. My project seeks to investigate the mechanisms of plant regeneration by using a previously developed transformation system overexpressing BBM and GRF-GIF (GGB system). To address this, I am performing a time course RNA-Sequencing experiment on wild type and GGB calli to assess differential expression of important stem cell development regulators. Moreover, I am examining auxin dynamics in GGB calli by visualizing the expression and localization of the PINFORMED1(PIN1) auxin efflux transporter using timelapse confocal microscopy. The characterization of gene expression and hormone dynamics in the GGB system will enable us to better understand and enhance the plant regeneration process. Improving plant regeneration will make plant transformation and agricultural biotechnology more efficient.

## Abstract

Plant organ size and shape is controlled by meristem proliferation and differentiation. Meristem size is regulated by the CLAVATA (CLV)-WUSCHEL (WUS) signaling pathway, which involves an interplay between CLV receptors, their ligands, and the mobile transcription factor WUS. Maize mutants lacking CLV receptors have fasciated ears, with flattened tips and disordered kernel rows, a result of overproliferating meristematic cells. One such mutant, fasciated ear3 (fea3), lacks a functional copy of a leucine rich receptor-like protein. Weak fea3 alleles increase ear size without a compensatory loss in seed size, making this an attractive target for yield enhancement. The molecular mechanism by which FEA3 exerts its control on meristem size is unknown, as FEA3 is expressed in a spatially distinct domain from other CLV receptors, and fea3 interacts additively with other CLV receptor mutants.Intriguingly, a CLV1 paralog, ZmBARELY ANY MERISTEM 1D (ZmBAM1D), is upregulated in fea3 mutants. FEA3 and ZmBAM1D expression overlaps in the center of spikelet meristems and the two proteins interact when co-expressed in N. benthamiana. While bam1d does not have an ear phenotype, fea3;bam1d mutants are more fasciated than fea3 mutants, suggesting that the two genes interact. Furthermore, both FEA3 and ZmBAM1D perceive the same CLE peptide ligand. These observations suggest that FEA3 and ZmBAM1D may form a receptor-co-receptor pair. We are validating the interaction between ZmBAM1D and FEA3 and discovering additional in vivo interactors using proximity labeling with TurboID, which can better resolve transient protein-protein interactions compared to immunoprecipitation-based approaches. Since BAM receptors have pleiotropic roles in plant development and defense, comparing the proximity labeling interactome of ZmBAM1D and FEA3 may also help reveal how signaling specificity is achieved in different biological contexts. With a deeper understanding of how these receptors regulate meristem activity, we can more precisely engineer this process to enhance yield-related traits.

## Abstract

The post-embryonic formation of the plant body proceeds in a sequential manner through the action of meristems, organized structures containing plant stem cells. Tightly coordinated meristematic regulation is required for proper development and reproductive success, eventually determining yield in crop species. In maize, the RAMOSA ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2) family of transcriptional corepressor proteins includes four members, REL2, RELK1 (REL2-LIKE1), RELK2, and RELK3. In an unbiased genetic screen for enhancers of the rel2 mutant, we identified double mutants with fewer and shorter internodes, and enlarged female inflorescence meristems (IMs) carrying mutations in RELK1. We show that RELK1 partially buffers the developmental defects of rel2 mutants and actively compensates for the loss of REL2 function. We therefore investigated the function and relationship among the various family members by also generating CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations in RELK2 and RELK3. Our analysis shows that RELK genes have largely redundant functions in the development and maintenance of various meristem types throughout the plant life cycle. Analysis of different triple mutant combinations revealed that REL2, RELK1, RELK2, and RELK3 function redundantly during embryogenesis and in the formation and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Different double mutants demonstrated that ear formation requires REL2 and RELK3 while REL2, RELK1 and RELK2 are required for maintenance of ear IM. Overall, REL2 functions as the essential gene, while the other members appear dispensable and can only partially compensate its loss. We are currently assessing to what extent activate compensation mechanisms are in play among the various family members. Expression analysis show that REL2 and RELK1 cooperatively regulate female IM development by regulating genes involved in redox balance, hormone catabolism, and differentiation ultimately tipping the meristem toward a molecular environment favorable to expanded expression of ZmWUS1, encoding a stem-cell promoting transcription factor. We also show that the loss of one functional copy of REL2 can promote an increase in kernel row number across a diverse set of F1 hybrid combinations. Our findings reveal that the REL2 family of transcriptional corepressors maintains maize development from embryonic initiation to reproductive growth and can potentially be harnessed for increasing seed yield in a major crop species.We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (IOS#2026561).

## Abstract

Maize leaves comprise a proximal sheath surrounding the stem and a distal, photosynthetic blade. The blade/sheath boundary is demarcated by an epidermal fringe of ligule tissue and the multi-layered auricle, which forms triangular-hinges that create leaf-angle. Leaf-angle describes the bending of the distal blade away from the proximal sheath, a key architectural trait and a target for crop improvement. Multiple components influence leaf-angle, including auricle size, shape and wrapping, as well as the mechanical strength of the midrib. Candidate genes regulating leaf-angle have been identified by genetic, quantitative genetic, and transcriptomic analyses, enabling models of gene regulatory networks. Nonetheless, little is known about the control of leaf-angle variation in the lower-versus-upper canopy of maize plants. Here we describe a systems biology approach combining single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) analysis of the emerging ligule/auricle in lower-canopy and upper-canopy leaves, and dynamic modeling of gene regulatory networks, to probe the mechanism of leaf-angle variation in maize. Three inbred lines (EP1, B104 and B73) were sampled, each of which shows distinct variation in leaf-angle within the canopy. Specifically, upper-leaves have increased leaf-angle (i.e. are flatter) in inbred EP1, but are gradually more upright in inbred B73. In contrast, inbred B104 displays equivalent leaf-angle in the upper and lower canopies. We used single-cell RNAseq to profile the transcriptomic landscapes of early-staged ligule/auricles from the lower (below ear leaf) and upper canopy (above ear leaf) in the three inbred lines. A total of 25 cell-clusters were identified in the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of all scRNAseq samples. Inbred lines showed cell-cluster separation. Comparisons of upper and lower canopy revealed cell-cluster separation within all inbred lines, although the degree of separation is less in B104. Finally, we introduce a dynamic model to systematically describe the mechanisms of maize ligule/auricle development, and its variation in the maize leaf canopy.

## Abstract

During development, boundaries separate cell populations with different fates. In plants, boundaries have been shown to be regions of restricted growth that make critical contributions to morphogenesis. The maize leaf provides an opportunity to study a relatively accessible boundary region called the preligule band (PLB). The PLB, which forms at the blade-sheath boundary, gives rise to two distinct structures, the ligule, and the auricles. The ligule, a membranous structure that covers the gap between consecutive leaves, arises exclusively from the PLB epidermis. The auricles are wedge-shaped structures that develop immediately distal to the ligule and contribute to blade angle. Here, we characterize ligule development in terms of epidermal topography, cell geometry, division orientation, and cell wall rigidity. The ligule development program is linked to cell wall rigidification within the PLB. Differential growth of cells in the sheath, PLB, and blade contributed to the formation of a shallow ridge within the PLB, which ultimately produces the ligule fringe. Subsequent changes in division plane orientation, cell geometry and cell wall stiffness are consistent with the partitioning of the PLB into at least two distinct zones prior to ligule outgrowth. Our findings lay an important foundation for future experiments and highlight the maize ligular region as a promising system for studying the relationships between gene expression, biomechanics, and growth during plant organogenesis.

## Abstract

The Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center (WCIC), part of the University of Wisconsin – Madison, is a ~100,000 ft2 facility operating as the largest public sector fee-for-service plant transformation laboratory in North America. Following a conventional protocol, the WCIC routinely genetically transforms the elite maize inbred LH244, a B73-related line recently released from intellectual property protection. In the near future, the WCIC will offer as a service a developmental gene facilitated transformation path which will increase the potential to transform more maize inbreds. Over-expression and/or CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing is currently available in LH244. All transformation starts with a contract negotiation between UW and the client’s institution and upon execution, the transformation pipeline can begin. Typically, LH244 transformation starts with binary plasmid vector design and assembly as a service within the WCIC. In the near future, DIRECTCLONE plasmids, which enable simplified integration of user genes/guide RNA will be available. Upon the creation or delivery of a transformation vector, Agrobacterium stocks are created and then used to make transgenic maize. Regenerated plantlets from culture are sent to the greenhouse for plant analysis of the selection marker. For overexpression vectors, copy number services are available to identify single locus events. Plants will be advanced and selfed or outcrossed to generate T1 seed. WCIC will even advance the T1 seed generation and screen it to grow homozygous T1 plants to bulk T2 seed for direct trials, and/or the creation of hemizygous transgenic hybrid T2 seed from the T1 plants outcrossed to a second inbred parent. For editing vectors, T0 leaf tissue samples are available to be shipped for the client to evaluate editing efficiency and a seed-expressed color gene marker is included to assist segregation of the edit from the editing locus in the T1 seed. In the near future, WCIC will offer edit evaluation in-house. All transgenic seed is available to be shipped to the client after completion of USDA-APHIS permits required for interstate seed shipment.

## Abstract

The micronutrient boron is essential for plant development. Boron, in form of boric acid, is taken up by plants from the soil. Therefore, soil boron deficiency, which is a global problem, negatively affects crop yield and quality. While studies on boron deficiency-induced defects in maize have focused on shoot parameters, knowledge regarding the impact of boron deficiency on maize roots and the underlying causes is scarce. Most cellular boron is located in cell walls, crosslinking the pectic subunits rhamnogalacturonan II. Recent findings highlight boron deficiency-induced cell division defects and boron-phytohormone relations, opening up intriguing avenues to reveal potential cell wall-independent functions of boron. The experimental induction of boron deficiency is challenging, as boron is ubiquitous. Phenylboronic acid (PBA), which is structurally similar to boric acid, is proposed to compete with boric acid for boron binding sites, therefore inducing boron deficiency. Our study aims to characterize boron deficiency-induced defects in the maize primary root using PBA. We characterized the boron deficiency-induced defects in maize roots through time course experiments and compared these defects to those induced by PBA. PBA treatment and boron deficiency (using boron-free Hoagland medium) exhibited similar defects with different severity. Both treatments significantly reduced the lateral roots density and primary root length compared to conditions with adequate boron. In addition, histology results revealed that PBA treatment significantly increased the thickness of the primary root. The boron deficiency-induced reduction in lateral root density was correlated with a reduction in lateral root primordia numbers, indicating defects in lateral root initiation. The potential connection to the auxin cascade and cell division for these defects was assessed through time course experiments with auxin biosynthesis mutants and transgenic marker lines. Our results pinpoint boron-deficiency induced cellular and molecular defects, shedding light on the functions of boron during primary root development of maize.

## Abstract

The evolution of cis-regulatory regions is critical for evolutionary divergence in gene function. One class of developmental genes that may have shifted in function following cis-regulatory change are the class I HD-ZIP transcription factor genes. Class I HD-ZIPs control multiple developmental programs in flowering plants and have deep conserved roles in grasses like maize, barley, and wheat. For example, GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1) is a pleiotropic domestication gene involved in repressing growth in multiple developmental contexts, including in lateral buds, roots, leaves, and floral organs. A cis-regulatory region upstream of GT1 (prol1.1) underlies a major QTL for ear number (prolificacy). To dissect the function and evolution of prol1.1, we have traced the evolution of conserved non-coding sequences in the grasses, and are editing the GT1 promoter in Zea mays and Brachypodium distachyon to determine how GT1’s pleiotropic functions are regulated and conserved in the grass family. RNA in situ hybridization in Zea mays and Setaria viridis suggest that GT1 homologs have conserved expression patterns in degenerating tissues. Our work will help us understand the evolution of this important, pleiotropic domestication gene, and precisely modulate gene expression in the grasses.

## Abstract

The critical transition in the maize life cycle involves a shift from vegetative growth, characterized by leaf production from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), to reproductive growth, where the SAM produces floral organs. Known as the floral transition, this pivotal stage occurs early in development and is influenced by a combination of internal cues and external signals, such as photoperiod and temperature. The timing of the floral transition significantly impacts flowering, the stage at which the plant releases pollen and develops silks—a crucial adaptive trait subject to selection. Maize varieties adapted to temperate latitudes exhibit photoperiod insensitivity, flowering consistently under both short and long day conditions. In contrast, tropical maize, retaining much of the photoperiod sensitivity of its progenitor teosinte, requires short days to flower within a similar timeframe as temperate maize. To comprehensively understand the photoperiod sensitivity of tropical maize and its effects on various developmental traits, we conducted field-based phenotyping of specific temperate and tropical maize genotypes for two consecutive years—Hawaii (short days) and Iowa (long days). This poster illustrates how the growing environment influences the timing of SAM reprogramming, total plant leaf count, and the days to flowering in these genotypes. Our analysis also explores the interplay between photoperiod and temperature on flowering timing. We sampled for gene expression analysis and currently, we are in the process of analyzing the diurnal expression patterns before and after the flowering transition under field conditions under short days. Unraveling how these genotypes respond in diverse environments lays the foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms distinguishing photoperiod-sensitive from photoperiod-insensitive maize varieties

## Abstract

Callus induction is a key step for genetic transformation and regeneration of maize. Two types of calli, type I and type II, are derived from maize tissue culture. Type II grows faster and is more responsive for regeneration. The degree of type II callus induction is dependent on genotype, although the mechanisms and genetic basis are poorly understood. A188 is a regeneration-amenable inbred line used for genetic transformation, while B73 is a recalcitrant inbred line. A188 and B73 have high and low type II callus induction rates, respectively. Analysis of type I and II calli from a B73xA188 F2 population through single callus genotyping and pooled callus RNA-seq identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for callus type at chromosomes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The analysis also identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two callus types. Currently, we are examining the impact of the DEGs on callus development by ectopic gene expression in maize immature embryos. At the same time, the quantification of the callus type of double haploids (DHs) from the cross between A188 and B73 led to the selection of highly culturable DH lines, providing a new genetic resource for maize transformation.

## Abstract

Sperm cells of flowering plants accomplish double fertilization via attachment and subsequent fusion of sperm cells to the egg cell and polar nuclei in the embryo sac, giving rise to the embryo and endosperm respectively. Mutations in both the Arabidopsis and maize GEX2 orthologs are associated with reduced mutant transmission, and an increased production of aborted kernels when transmitted through the male; likely due to defects in gamete attachment. To better understand GEX2 function, we have characterized phenotypes associated with two different mutations in the maize gex2 gene caused by insertion of an engineered GFP-marked transposable element. Although both insertions interrupt GEX2 coding sequence, the alleles are associated with a statistically significant difference in transmission defect severity. We are using RT-PCR to investigate whether the less severe phenotype is linked to alterations in splicing or protein structure.Use of anthocyanin markers indicates that the most severe gex2 allele is associated with an increased rate of heterofertilization, where the egg cell and central cell are fertilized by different pollen tubes. Genotyping the embryo and endosperm of heterofertilized kernels shows 88.2% are associated with gex2 fertilization of the egg cell. Conversely, aborted kernels from male gex2 crosses typically develop endosperm without embryo, suggesting that these abortions are a result of single fertilization of the central cell. Taken together, these data suggest that gex2 sperm are associated with high rates of single fertilization, with fertilization recovery rescuing those associated with the egg but not central cell. To further investigate the gex2 heterofertilization phenotype, we adapted the pollen preservation approach of Shoemaker et al. 2022 to a double pollination protocol that facilitates measurement of heterofertilization rate. Comparison with previous results will allow validation of this new method, as well as determination of whether the different gex2 alleles also differentially influence heterofertilization.

## Abstract

In order to feed the Earth’s ever-increasing population without compromising its remaining wild areas, agricultural productivity desperately needs to increase. This is especially poignant in cereal crops, which provide the largest source of global calories and yet remain broadly understudied compared to their eudicot relatives. Maximising the yield of these staple crops will require a greater understanding of the networks underpinning their development, including, crucially, the formation and development of their organs; one way to find genes important for such development is through mutant analysis. A fundamental step in organ development is the delineation of the differentiating organ cells (primordium) from the pool of stem cells (meristem) via the formation of a boundary region. Here, we present a new mutant in maize in which this boundary is defective both between primordia and between primordia and the meristem, called fused leaf 1.

## Abstract

In this experiment, we sought to understand hormonal regulation in maize mutants large scutellar node1 (lsn1) and Hairy sheath frayed1 (Hsf1). The mutant lsn1 is characterized by abnormal vein patterning, a flattened and enlarged root tip, as well as a short shoot, and a short root with few lateral roots. The lsn1 phenotype is reported to be caused by defects in auxin transport which we hypothesize results in accumulation of auxin in the root tips stunting growth. We theorize that this would lead to lower levels of cytokinin in the root tips. The mutant Hsf1 is also distinguished by an abnormal phenotype, with hairs present on the surface of the leaves. The roots have been reported to be shorter than normal with fewer lateral roots. Hsf1 has a higher level of cytokinin signaling, and therefore we hypothesize that there would be lower levels of auxin present in the root tips. To test our hypotheses, we crossed the two mutants together to examine the double mutant phenotype. As auxin and cytokinin often act in opposition to each other, we predicted that the the double mutant would have a more normal phenotype. Come to the poster to find out what happened instead. This research expands upon existing research on these plant growth hormones, and how they affect root development.

## Abstract

Monitoring the progression of DNA replication can give insights into S phase and overall cell cycle kinetics. For this purpose, the thymidine analogs, 5-ethynyl-2 ́-deoxyuridine (EdU) and 5-bromo-2 ́-deoxyuridine (BrdU), have been used extensively to label newly replicated DNA during S phase. Combining both analogs in a sequential EdU followed by BrdU dual-pulse opens new opportunities for further defining S-phase kinetics using less experimental material. We adapted procedures for EdU-BrdU dual pulse labeling from mammalian cell lines and incorporated them with our published procedures for single-labeling with EdU in maize root tips for analysis by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Key technical optimization steps will be presented, including appropriate controls and how to monitor and balance the optimal DNA denaturation for BrdU antibody detection while maintaining sufficient double-stranded DNA for DAPI intercalation and DNA content measurements. This approach can be applied with various labeling times to enable new questions about different spatio-temporal aspects of S-phase progression. For example, by first labeling with EdU to identify cells in S phase, followed by a 1-hour thymidine chase, and then labeling with BrdU, we can determine how many cells have exited S phase at a later time point. By quantifying these populations with a flow cytometer, S-phase duration can be estimated from a single sample. In contrast, the EdU-only approach required lengthy time courses and much more plant material to estimate S-phase duration. In addition, combining dual labeling with fluorescence activated nuclei sorting (FANS) allows for the characterization of cytologically distinct labeling patterns separated by defined time intervals within single nuclei, revealing aspects of DNA replication progression.

## Abstract

Evolutionary innovations are often achieved by co-opting existing molecular structures to perform new functions, a concept commonly referred to as “molecular tinkering”. Gene duplication is a powerful source of biological innovation, giving rise to duplicates (hereafter, paralogs) that undergo diverse fates and drive evolutionary change. Redundancy between paralogous genes is an intriguing outcome of duplicate gene evolution, and its maintenance over evolutionary time has long been considered a paradox. Genetic studies in yeast and plants have suggested that the ability of ancient redundant duplicates to compensate for dosage perturbations resulting from a loss of function depends on the reprogramming of gene expression, a phenomenon known as active compensation. Our research work focuses on the maize trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases RAMOSA3 and TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE 4, two important meristem development regulators, as a model for studying the reprogramming of paralogs. By using quantitative imaging, chromatin accessibility assays, and promoter editing our work is investigating the hypothesis that cis-regulatory elements control paralogous compensation by binding to factors that regulate transcription. Understanding the transcriptional mechanisms of reprogramming among duplicated genes could allow us to fine-tune traits controlled by redundant paralogs, and improve the predictability of gene editing outcomes.

## Abstract

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are composed of coding and non-coding DNA elements that control gene expression. They have become an essential aspect towards crop improvement by revealing modules that influence stress response, development, and plant evolution. Such GRNs are best created through multi-omics approaches in specific tissues to strengthen candidate genes and loci for functional characterization and ultimate incorporation into breeding programs. Combining transcriptomics, transcription factor (TF) binding profiles, and other genomic metrics, we construct dense sorghum GRNs to understand conserved and divergent modules that influence inflorescence development across multiple Sorghum Association Panel accessions, including breeding, non-breeding, and conversion lines. Developmentally crucial gene sets can still show notable differences in expression across inchoate tissue stages, suggesting a level of genetic redundancy or plasticity exists towards creating similar panicle morphologies. Additionally, TFs that are known regulators of inflorescence meristem progression in monocots, like Bearded Ear1 and Tassel Sheath 4, have different binding profiles in the promoter regions of these meristematic gene clusters and also indicate which TFs could have a more promiscuous regulatory purview compared to others. Finally, comparing the sorghum results with maize transcriptomic profiles also revealed which orthologous genes are conserved in their regulation through different TFs between maize and sorghum. This project was funded by the USDA-ARS award number 8062-21000-044-000D.

## Abstract

Tar spot, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungal pathogen Phyllachora maydis, is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of maize (Zea mays L.) within the United States. P. maydis may also be found in association with other fungi, forming a disease complex which is thought to result in the characteristic fish eye lesions. Understanding how P. maydis colonizes maize leaf cells is essential for developing effective disease control strategies. Here, we used histological approaches to elucidate how P. maydis infects and multiplies within susceptible maize leaves. We collected tar spot-infected maize leaf samples from four different fields in northern Indiana at three different time points during the growing season. Samples were chemically fixed and paraffin-embedded for high-resolution light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed a consistent pattern of disease progression in independent leaf samples collected across different geographical regions. Each stroma contained a central pycnidium that produced asexual spores. Perithecia with sexual spores developed in the stomatal chambers adjacent to the pycnidium, and a cap of spores formed over the stroma. P. maydis reproductive structures formed around but not within the vasculature. We observed P. maydis associated with two additional fungi, one of which is likely a member of the Paraphaeosphaeria genus; the other is an unknown fungi. Our data provide fundamental insights into how this pathogen colonizes and spreads within maize leaves. This knowledge can inform new approaches to managing tar spot, which could help mitigate the significant economic losses caused by this disease.

## Abstract

Efficient C4 photosynthesis requires high vein density to shuttle carbon from mesophyll to vascular bundle sheath cells. Maize leaves have several vein subtypes (lateral, intermediate, small, and transverse) defined by their sequence of development and spatial configuration. Amongst these, small veins make up most of the vascular tissue in the leaf and preferentially develop in the photosynthetically active blade. We are using natural diversity within the Wisconsin Diversity Panel (WiDiv) to identify genes influencing vascular density. We collected 6000+ leaf samples from 750+ WiDiv lines over three field seasons. To quantify microscopic vascular traits on a large scale we built a deep-learning phenotyping system that estimates subtype-specific vein density in images of cleared leaf tissues. The system implements a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for semantic, pixel-by-pixel image segmentation and vein-subtype classification. Because leaf physiology and vein density vary over leaf compartments, we trained a second U-Net model to segment leaf images into sheath, auricle, and blade, allowing for compartment specific phenotyping and GWAS. We used activation mapping and ‘DeepDream’-style feature visualization to show how the model interprets the leaf images at different levels of its architecture, showing that early model layers conduct fundamental image processing such as edge detection while later layers consider the spatial configuration of multiple vein subtypes. We used our data to perform correlation analysis between vein phenotypes and traits from other datasets. Our system also detects widespread ‘bundle-sheath fusions’, where ectopic bundle sheath cells appear between small veins in place of mesophyll cells, violating the spacing required for C4 photosynthesis. We used FarmCPU to conduct a preliminary vein trait GWAS on 14M+ publicly available SNPs, which revealed a polygenic genetic architecture for leaf vein phenotypes. These candidate loci will guide future studies in C4 vascular density and arrangement.

## Abstract

Life on earth is marked by an incredible diversity in form and function, but how this diversity is defined and coordinated throughout development remains a fundamental question in biology. Organ shape poses an attractive target for crop improvement given that it can profoundly influence plant productivity, but how organ shape is controlled remains unclear. Boundary formation between and within organs is crucial for shape determination. These boundaries are defined during the earliest stages of development, when meristematic cells begin differentiating into distinct domains. Determination and maintenance of these domains influences growth patterns within the primordia to direct how an organ will be shaped. However, the gene regulatory networks underlying domain patterning and boundary specification and how they are modified to generate morphological diversity remain unknown. In maize the BZIP transcription factor LIGULELESS2 (LG2) is thought to have a key role in defining boundaries between domains in different organs. lg2 mutants lack a clear boundary between the leaf sheath and blade, the tassel has fewer branches, and there are defects in bract formation. How LG2 functions during the development of these different organs, and specifies boundaries is unclear. To address this, we are combining RNAseq, ChIPseq and CoIP to build the gene regulatory network that LG2 acts in. Through comparing the GRN between organs we hope to identify both core components, providing insight into how boundaries may be specified and maintained in growing organs, and key organ-specific changes that may be responsible for morphological differences.

## Abstract

Grafting is a technique that has been used in agriculture for millennia to combine two genetically distinct crop varieties to create a plant with maximally beneficial shoot and root traits. Previously it was thought that graft compatibility was an exclusive trait of dicotyledonous species, however a recent study reported a method of grafting in monocots by preforming the grafting in pre-germinated seeds and kernels. Indeed, we have developed a protocol and shown the ability of Zea mays to form a symplastic connection between primary root and shoot in both homo- and heterografts. However, this method requires destruction of the grafted shoot to confirm successful connection of the tissues. Here we present results from a novel shoot/shoot grafting method in which two individual maize shoots are fused at the mesocotyl during germination. Fused shoots were genotyped using molecular markers and phloem-xylem connectivity established by administering radioactive 11CO2 to a source leaf on one shoot and measuring phloem transport of [11C]-photosynthate down the shoot to the roots and back up the second shoot via the xylem. Gamma ray counting and autoradiography were used for these measurements. In subsequent studies, shoot/shoot xylem connectivity will be examined using radioactive 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose administered hydroponically through a select set of nodal roots connected to just one of the shoots. We expect that with its ease of use and visual scoring coupled with the high rate of shoot/shoot fusion our method will become the standard grafting protocol for maize in the future. Grafting in maize will allow researchers to unravel long distance signaling networks, secondary metabolite production, and source-sink dynamics throughout the maize lifecycle.

## Abstract

The maize leaf has three morphologically distinct domains: a flat photosynthesizing blade, a rigid sheath grasping the stem, and a ligule with flexible auricle connecting blade to sheath. We previously showed Wavy auricle in blade2 (Wab2) is a semi-dominant leaf mutant which produces ectopic auricle-like tissue in the blade. Expression of Wab2 is highly variable in heterozygotes. We attempted to identify the underlying genetic mechanism by crossing Wab2 introgressed into the B73 background with W22. B73-Wab2 x W22 F1 hybrids did not express the Wab2 phenotype (N=40), demonstrating that one or more dominant suppressor loci modify expression of Wab2 in W22. We characterized the F2 generation to understand the genetic architecture of this suppression and identify causative loci by bulk segregant analysis (BSA) mapping-by-sequencing. Although genotyping via a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker revealed that inheritance of the Wab2 allele matched Mendelian ratios (N=142), phenotypic ratios displayed significant suppression of the Wab2 allele in both heterozygotes and homozygotes. Here we used chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests to show that a single dominant suppressor, is the most parsimonious explanation for non-Mendelian variation in auricle-like tissue phenotypic expression. Because of its function in restoring wildtype blade morphology, we refer to this locus as WHETSTONE1 (WTS1). When the W22 allele, WTS1-W22 is present Wab2 is suppressed, whereas the B73 allele, WTS1-B73 allows Wab2 to be expressed. Using our genotypic and phenotypic data, we collected DNA from pools of 51 Wab2 suppressed individuals and 51 Wab2 expressed individuals from this F2 population to identify WTS1 through BSA mapping-by-sequencing with an allelic distance approach. Ongoing work will explore molecular genetic interactions between Wab2 and WTS1 in driving maize leaf morphology. Potential future steps include fine mapping and functional validation using gene knockout or overexpression to confirm the role of WTS1 in leaf morphology.

## Abstract

The maize leaf is separated into three genetic domains: a blade optimized for photosynthesis, a sheath wrapped tightly around the stem that provides structural support, and a ligule/auricle that acts as a hinge bridging the blade and sheath. We have been characterizing Wavy Auricle in Blade2 (Wab2), a maize leaf mutant that produces ectopic clusters of auricle-like tissue in the blade. Wab2 exhibits incomplete dominance and variable expressivity as a heterozygote. Histology of the Wab2 shoot apex showed multiple bands of actively dividing cells as early as the fifth leaf primordium (P5) from the meristem, resembling blade-sheath boundary tissues where the wild-type auricle forms. Bulk segregant sequencing identified a rough mapping interval on chromosome 4. RNA-seq analysis showed a predicted TCP transcription factor, tcptf15 (Zm00001eb179560), is 100-fold overexpressed in Wab2 mutants and the only differentially-expressed gene within the mapping interval. As the dominant allele of Wavy Auricle in Blade1 (Wab1-R) was previously shown to be caused by an overexpressed TCP transcription factor, tcptf15 has become our primary candidate gene for Wab2. To demonstrate tcptf15 is necessary for the Wab2 phenotype, we designed 4 sgRNAs against the locus that assemble using Gate Cloning, to create a revertant loss-of-function allele in the Wab2 background by CRISPR/Cas9. Double mutants between Wab2 and multiple wab1 loss-of-function alleles show wab1 is epistatic to Wab2. Unexpectedly, plants heterozygous for wab1-rev and wab1-MA also suppressed the Wab2 phenotype. We hypothesize that physical interaction between Wab2 and DNA-binding defective wab1-rev or wab1-MA proteins may explain heterozygous suppression. Future work will examine potential interactions between these proteins and place Wab2 within a genetic pathway for leaf development. There are still many questions left to be answered as we press forward in our study of this mutant.

## Abstract

The phytohormone auxin controls plant growth and development. Auxin treatment of developing seedlings results in a strong inhibition of root growth. A concentration curve was performed with the synthetic auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), on B73 maize seedlings grown in the dark. A concentration of 25 µM resulted in 85% reduction in root length. To identify genes involved in auxin perception and sensitivity we screened a set of B73-EMS M2 families treated with 25 µM 2,4-D and discovered one family that segregated seedlings with long roots and a reduction in nodal roots compared to wild-type controls. These insensitive mutants segregated in a recessive fashion and had altered growth and development under light grown conditions. The 2,4-D insensitive mutants had fewer leaves and were 54% shorter than wild-type controls. Tassel architecture was also affected as the mutant tassels were 51% shorter in length and had reduced tassel branching. To map the causative mutation, an F2 mapping population was created with Mo17. Bulk-segregant analysis and next generation sequencing was performed on a pool of 2,4-D insensitive mutants. A map region on chromosome 4 was identified by mapping SNPs between the mutant sequence pool and B73 reference genome. Only a single high effect transition mutation was identified in the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated1 (cand1) gene resulting in a premature stop codon. The CAND1 protein is responsible for recycling the AUXIN-RELATED F-BOX (AFB) proteins involved in auxin perception. Continued work is underway to further characterize the mutant phenotype and identify a second allele.

## Abstract

The phytohormone auxin is essential for regulating plant growth and development. Proper spatiotemporal auxin distribution is required to maintain stem cell populations and promote cellular differentiation during organogenesis. Auxin transporters from the PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and ABC families are required for maize development, but the roles of the evolutionarily ancient PIN-LIKES (PILS) proteins are not well understood. Free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, or “auxin”) levels within the primary root are asymmetrically distributed, suggesting that this pattern is established by regulated transport and/or biosynthesis. Using reverse genetics, we have identified two ER-localized PILS proteins that influence auxin transport in roots. Knockdown alleles of PILS6 in maize display altered auxin response in seedlings and impaired vegetative development, including reduced shoot height and crown root architecture. pils6 roots have extensive proteome and phosphoproteome remodeling compared to W22, including extensive changes to hormone signaling and cell proliferation related proteins. PILS6 protein interactors were predicted using this proteomics data and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Within the PILS6 co-expression network are kinases, trafficking proteins, and other membrane transporters. Based on these findings, a working model for the roles of PILS6 in driving maize root and shoot formation will be presented, which may inform strategies for generating desirable architectural traits.

## Abstract

All flowering plants, including maize, form their plant body in repetitive units called phytomers, which consists of a node, an internode, leaf and an axillary bud. Internodes have meristematic tissue called intercalary meristems at their base which enable the stem to elongate after the floral transition. Intercalary meristems divide and the cells elongate which leads to internode elongation and increase in plant height. Any defects in intercalary meristems will disrupt internode elongation and affect plant height. Through an EMS mutation screen in maize, we identified the tasseless5 (tls5) mutation which has defects in internode elongation in various parts of the stem, leading to reduced plant height. Additional defects include short tassels with fewer spikelets and branches and the tassels fail to emerge out of the whorl most of the time, hence the name tassel-less. Furthermore, multiple ears are visible which are small, compared to the normal maize ears. We have mapped the candidate region to chromosome 9 and are using a whole genome resequencing approach to identify possible candidate genes. Identifying the tls5 gene and characterizing its function will provide insight into intercalary meristem development in maize internodes and uncover the additional role of the gene in maize reproductive development.

## Abstract

Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) has been documented to be increased in maize hybrids with both uptake and internal use phenotypes enhanced compared to inbred parents. Some traits involved in this are reliant on developmental phase-specific variations in organ nutrient remobilization such as stay-green, inspiring a season-wide assay of leaf-level gene regulation. B73, H99, and F1 hybrids of B73 and H99 were grown in paired N-deficient and -sufficient plots and sampled at early and mid-vegetative, and flowering timepoints for RNA-sequencing. H99 knockout mutants of a key nitrate transporter and F1 crosses of this mutant with B73 were grown and sampled in the same field in order to further dissect the role of nitrogen status signaling in heterosis NUE. Classical likelihood ratio testing reveals differential gene expression of expected nitrogen metabolism genes and indicates possible master regulators associated with their targets by gene network inference. With the quality of the pan-genome, SNP-aware alignment and RNA quantification also helps to piece apart the gene expression contribution of each parent and demystify some of the regulatory landscape.

## Abstract

Networks are powerful tools to uncover functional roles of genes in phenotypic variation at a system-wide scale. Here, we constructed a maize network map that contains the genomic, transcriptomic, translatomic and proteomic networks across maize development. This map comprises over 2.8 million edges in more than 1,400 functional subnetworks, demonstrating an extensive network divergence of duplicated genes. We applied this map to identify factors regulating flowering time and identified 2,651 genes enriched in eight subnetworks. We validated the functions of 20 genes, including 18 with previously unknown connections to flowering time in maize. Furthermore, we uncovered a flowering pathway involving histone modification. The multi-omics integrative network map illustrates the principles of how molecular networks connect different types of genes and potential pathways to map a genome-wide functional landscape in maize, which should be applicable in a wide range of species.

## Abstract

Climate change has severely affected maize productivity worldwide. To mitigate the issue, a holistic understanding of metabolic crosstalk among its organs is important. Thereby, we reconstructed the first multi-organ maize metabolic model, iZMA6517, and contextualized it with heat and cold stress transcriptomics data using EXpression disTributed REAction flux Measurement (EXTREAM) algorithm. Furthermore, implementing metabolic bottleneck analysis on contextualized models revealed differences between these stresses. While both stresses had reducing power bottlenecks, heat stress had additional energy generation bottlenecks. We also performed thermodynamic driving force analysis, revealing thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis dictating the nature of temperature stress responses. Thus, a temperature-tolerant maize ideotype can be engineered by leveraging the proposed thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis. We experimentally inoculated maize root with a beneficial mycorrhizal fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, and as a proof-of-concept demonstrated its efficacy in alleviating temperature stress. Overall, this study will guide the engineering effort of temperature stress-tolerant maize ideotypes.

## Abstract

Maize has a wealth of phenotypic and molecular diversity, exceeding that of most model organisms and a great many wild and cultivated plants. Nucleotide diversity, including SNPs and small indels, as well as more complex structural variants such as translocations and inversions, are frequently used to estimate polymorphism in a population. Efforts to represent nucleotide diversity in maize have ranged widely in scope (e.g., the first HapMap project in 2009 captured 3.3 million SNPs and indels in 27 diverse maize inbred lines, and a 2023 project identified approximately 366 million segregating and 46 million high-confidence variants in 1,515 resequenced maize lines across maize wild relatives, landraces, and tropical and temperate lines). However, because of the divergence in pipelines and reference genome versions used in these studies, comparisons across data sets are difficult. Differences in reference genome versions, read mapping algorithms and parameters, and variant calling can make it difficult to know why variants exist in one data set but not another, and can lead to differing positions for the same variant. In order to address these continuity issues, The Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB – https://www.maizegdb.org) has collaborated with researchers in the maize community to offer variant data through a standardized haplotype-calling pipeline that uses BWA-MEM and Sentieon's Haplotyper and GVCFtyper against version 5 of the B73 reference genome. The first release of the dataset was generated using 1,498 resequenced lines from 10 projects and includes a diverse set of inbred lines, landraces, and teosintes. The data set was filtered for mapping quality, coverage, and linkage disequilibrium, and annotated based on variant effects relative to the B73 RefGen_v5 gene annotations. MaizeGDB created a web tool to filter, visualize, and download genotype sets based on genomic locations and accessions of interest. MaizeGDB plans to host a regularly updated version of these resources as additional resequencing data become available, with plans to expand to all publicly available sequence data.

## Abstract

Maize is pivotal in supporting global agriculture and addressing food security challenges. To better understand the genetic factors that underpin maize growth, quantitative phenotyping of traits is essential. Root systems are challenging to phenotype given their below-ground, soil-bound nature. In addition, manual annotations of root images are tedious and can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies between individuals, resulting in data discrepancies. To address these issues we have developed an automated phenotyping pipeline utilizing Root Painter , Rhizovision , and R for maize root image analysis and efficient extraction of phenotypic data. This pipeline was tested on images of field-grown maize crown root systems (stages V6-V8) from the Wisconsin Diversity panel. By minimizing user input and increasing automation, these tools improve the consistency and accuracy of data metrics. Root Painter, a segmentation application based on U-Net with a user-friendly interface, specializes in identifying roots and nodes. 123 images were annotated in RootPainter’s interface for training. Resulting in precise differentiation between roots and non-root structures, enabling unsupervised crown root phenotyping. Finally, these segmented images were subsequently processed using Rhizovision's batch image processor, extracting numerous key root traits, including total root length, network area, and volume. The output from Rhizovision was then analyzed using an R script, incorporating statistical and visualization packages. Comparing the results obtained from our automated phenotyping pipeline with manually measured root systems demonstrated increased accuracy and consistency across researchers. This integrated pipeline saves user time and reduces costs by harnessing open-source maize phenotyping software and robust data analysis techniques.

## Abstract

Orphan genes are young genes often generated by de novo gene birth from previously non-coding regions and encode proteins that have no homologs in other species. Orphan genes from diverse plant species have been experimentally demonstrated as essential for nutrient utilization, stress tolerance, or disease resistance. Orphan genes are often short in length and mono-exonic, and lack the canonical features of mature conserved genes. Hence, they are largely ignored by many gene prediction approaches. Using BIND, a gene prediction pipeline that combines ab initio prediction and evidence-based prediction utilizing ~1,500 publicly available maize B73 RNA-seq datasets from diverse biological conditions, we have identified ~38,000 transcripts that potentially encode orphan proteins. About 88% of these transcripts lie within genomic regions previously considered to be intergenic, and the remaining 12% are likely the alternative splicing products of mature genes. Approximately 1,500 orphan transcripts have translation evidence supported by analysis of 175 publicly available Ribo-seq datasets that contains only a subset of conditions of the RNA-seq datasets used to identify these orphan transcripts and thereby represents a lower bound. Three tools to evaluate coding-potential were employed to analyze the orphan transcripts, and ~39% are predicted to be protein-coding. Due to the lack of homology with other species, identifying functions of orphan genes is a major challenge. As an example strategy, we present a joint statistical analysis between the maize silk orphan transcriptome and cuticular wax metabolome. This analysis identifies ten orphans with translation evidence that are significantly associated with cuticular wax composition, thus providing novel directions for characterizing orphan function. Collectively, by identifying orphan transcripts expressing under specific conditions, this study demonstrates the complex and dynamic nature of the maize transcriptome and provides rich resources for further exploration of maize genome biology and its impact on crop phenotypes.

## Abstract

One of key reasons to develop a pan-genome is to bolster the process of identifying and characterizing causal polymorphisms for genes underlying phenotypic variations. Literature reviews show that large insertion and deletion (indel) polymorphism is an important category of casual polymorphisms, however, the process of identifying large indels from a pan-genome is challenging. To overcome this challenge, we first developed two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, CHOICE (Clustering HSPs for Ortholog Identification via Coordinates and Equivalence) and CLIPS (Clustering via Large-Indel Permuted Slopes), then constructed an interactive webapp BRIDGEcereal (https://bridgecereal.scinet.usda.gov/) to expedite this process. Over 120 assemblies, including 40 maize inbred genomes and other cereal crops, were compiled into the database. Through the intuitive graphical user interphase, the only required input is a gene model ID to mine through publicly available pan-genome for surveying and graphing indel-based haplotype.

## Abstract

Targeted genome editing and selection technologies have the potential to accelerate plant breeding pipelines in any species but require prior knowledge of what changes to make and where to make them. One promising approach for proposing effectual edits is by querying deep learning models trained to predict cellular features such as RNA expression from DNA input. Deep learning models benefit from large and diverse training sets of different tissues and genotypes, which are rarely available within a single species. To train RNA expression models on larger sample sizes, we leveraged new long-read genomes and RNA-seq data from 15 wild species closely related to maize, sorghum, and sugarcane. Millions of years of evolution across these species has resulted in a large, diverse pool of training alleles. As model input, we extracted 1,024 base pairs upstream of each gene’s translation start site. This sequence data was used to train model architectures shown to be state-of-the-art on human data. Testing the trained models on NAM parent expression data shows Spearman correlations between 0.45 and 0.55. All architectures fail to accurately rank NAM alleles by expression, showing an average Spearman correlation within a pan-gene of less than 0.10. This suggests that smaller state-of-the-art supervised models are neither able to generalize well across related species nor sensitively separate alleles within species, the latter of which agrees with recent work within humans. Large language models have demonstrated success in answering questions and modeling proteins but have so far been evaluated only on species in the training set for RNA expression tasks. A model that successfully learns gene regulation should be able to generalize to unseen related species. Therefore, we are releasing the dataset and codebase for this work as a community benchmark to evaluate new architectures on our across-species and across-allele tasks.

## Abstract

With increasing amounts of genomic data, the demand for fast, reproducible, and robust bioinformatic pipelines is paramount. The Breeders’ Genomics Hub, built on a JupyterHub framework, integrates a suite of open-source tools for collecting, analyzing, and predicting biological patterns from phenotypic and genotypic data. This unified platform not only streamlines data analysis but also simplifies pipeline documentation. Utilization of Jupyter Notebooks within the hub promotes sharing and reproducibility. One of the strengths of the Breeders’ Genomics Hub is it provides researchers with access to powerful, yet user-friendly, data sources and software tools. It leverages the Breeding Application Programming Interface (BrAPI) web services to retrieve data from common breeding databases using BreeDBase, BMS, or Gigwa. For instance, rTASSEL and rPHG, accessible via a R programming kernel in Jupyter Notebooks, connect users to TASSEL and the Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG). PHG is a graph-based tool for haplotype calling from high-throughput sequencing data. BioKotlin, a bioinformatics library offering the performance of compiled languages (>50-fold performance) with the ease of Python-like scripting, is also available on the Hub. Researchers can harness these tools to retrieve PHG data, integrate and preprocess it using rTASSEL and BioKotlin, visualize it with standard libraries, and employ machine learning or R models for insightful genomic predictions. By using the Breeders’ Genomics Hub to link data from multiple sources and perform advanced analysis plant breeders can gain valuable insights into the relationships between genotype and phenotype and make informed breeding decisions. Ultimately, the Breeders’ Genomics Hub not only fosters collaboration among scientists but also enables integration with genomic tools, offering a centralized repository for data pipelines and results.

## Abstract

Collecting brace root phenotyping data is instrumental to understanding the development and structural contributions of brace roots in maize and sorghum. Phenotypes such as brace root width, whorl count, emerged brace root count per whorl, and geometric attributes of stalk-to-ground architecture are extremely difficult and time-consuming to collect manually in the field. To efficiently collect this data at a large scale, we have developed the Brace Root Robot, named Brobot ( bˈrəʊbɒt ), a remote-controlled sand-crawler droid that takes high-fidelity images of brace roots in the field as it is piloted between rows. To extract the phenotyping features from these images, we have developed RootTaggingGUI to easily measure attributes of brace root architecture using pixel distances. In this poster, we discuss the accuracy and efficiency of the current implementation, as well as the improvements planned for the future, including a development path to autonomous driving of the Brobot and autonomous phenotypic feature extraction.

## Abstract

The chromatin structure of maize root nuclei was examined by analyzing nuclease sensitivity and cleavage patterns from the replication-active terminal 1 mm of the maize seedling root tip. We developed several related assays, including DNS-seq and MOA-seq, utilizing micrococcal nuclease (MNase) as a probe for chromatin structural features. These features are coupled to gene regulation, phenotypic traits, and cistrome occupancy. DNS-seq and MOA-seq generate NGS libraries from small DNA fragments isolated from formaldehyde-fixed chromatin, employing both defined and variable concentrations of MNase. We analyzed the terminal 1 mm of seedling root tip chromatin in conjunction with two projects: one aiming to map open chromatin (NSF IOS 1444532) and the other studying DNA replication timing (NSF IOS 2025811). Our data tracks are shared on MaizeGDB and via our UCSC genome browser on genomaize.org. DNA replication time profiling provides an orthogonal measure of chromatin status, ideal for integrative and comparative epigenomics. Here, we summarize the assays and data analysis pipelines for visualizing, mapping, and interpreting coverage data of MNase-produced DNA fragment centers (frenters) from maize root tip samples. The MNase coverage profiles facilitate peak calling to: (1) map nucleosome occupancy from DNS-seq heavy digest frenters, (2) identify large hyper-sensitive footprints revealing nucleosome-sized particles or large complexes from DNS-seq light digest large fragment frenters, (3) locate small hyper-sensitive footprints indicating transcription factor (TF) occupancy candidates for cis-element discovery and functional analyses from DNS-seq or MOA-seq, and (4) identify regions of potential false positives using chromatin-free purified DNA in MOA-seq-like digests. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how MNase digestion assays are useful for defining chromatin structural features at the level of DNA-protein particle locations, including nucleosomes and DNA-bound transcription or replication factors, thereby enhancing our understanding of epigenomic states and genetic processes.

## Abstract

Advances in genomic technologies have paved the way for high-quality de novo assembly of complex genomes, enabling researchers to unravel the intricacies of genetic architecture. This study presents the assembled and annotated genomes of two key maize inbreds, W22 and PH207. The W22 genome, historically recognized for its pivotal role in maize genetics, has served as a foundational resource for studies of paramutation. PH207, belonging to the Iodent germplasm, is a crucial asset for the production of temperate commercial maize lines and has played a significant role in heterotic hybrid development, shaping modern maize breeding programs. Leveraging PacBio HiFi long reads and Bionano optical maps, we achieved high-quality assemblies for both W22 and PH207. W22 exhibited a contig N50 of 135.8 Mb and an L50 of 7, comprising a total of 102 contigs. PH207 displayed a contig N50 of 73.6 Mb and an L50 of 9, consisting of 121 contigs. The final pseudomolecule assemblies were generated using pan-genome anchor markers. Our annotation strategy involves utilizing a diverse set of RNA-seq datasets, incorporating Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data for the precise identification and annotation of untranslated regions (UTRs). Additionally, Iso-Seq long reads will be employed to uncover full-length isoforms. We aim to comprehensively characterize the genomic composition by comparing the assemblies to existing maize inbred lines and fully characterizing the repeat elements in the genomes. The resulting assemblies and annotations, supported by genomic browser integration, will be publicly available on MaizeGDB. This detailed understanding of the genomic structure and content of W22 and PH207 will serve as invaluable resources for the maize research community, providing a foundation for further investigations into maize genetics, breeding, and functional genomics.

## Abstract

To assess how transcription, particularly the rate of transcription, correlates to maize root tip DNA replication timing, we made RNA-seq libraries from nascent, nuclear, and cellular RNA isolated from the 0-1 mm terminal portion of maize root tips. To obtain a more inclusive representation of the transcriptomes for mRNAs, non-polyA RNAs, antisense transcripts and long non-coding (lnc) RNAs in the RNA-seq libraries, we used ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion instead of polyA selection prior to library construction. We compared commercially available kits (Invitrogen RiboMinus, Vazyme Ribo-off, and Qiagen QiaFastSelect) for plants that use probe hybridization to rRNAs. To analyze the ribo-depletion efficiencies of the kits and to filter out highly repetitive transcripts like tRNAs and signal recognition particle (7SL/SRP) RNAs in the resulting RNA-seq data, we generated maize-specific, custom databases of 5S, 5.8S, 18S, 28S, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), mitochondrial and chloroplast rRNAs, tRNAs and SRP sequences to use with the SortMeRNA bioinformatic tool. All kits reduced the amount of rRNA, but none successfully removed all rRNAs. With the Vazyme kit, the type of RNA used for the library impacted the amount of rRNA contamination in the reads, with 10%, 30%, and 80% rRNA contaminants in the nascent, nuclear and cellular RNA-seq reads, respectively. In nuclear RNA-seq libraries, ~30% of the RNA-seq reads corresponded to rRNA sequences when either the Vazyme or the Qiagen kit was used. However, the kits differed in the types of rRNA that were not removed efficiently. The major read contaminant for the Vazyme kit was from 28S rRNA (89% of the reads removed by SortMeRNA databases), whereas for the Qiagen kit the major contaminants were from mitochondrial and ITS rRNAs (~60% and 27% of SortMeRNA reads, respectively). Further characterization of the kits and a description of how the maize rRNA databases were generated will be presented.

## Abstract

Adapting maize to climate change encompasses a three-way interaction between genetic variation, environmental plasticity, and directed evolution. Here, we show how interfacing digital and life sciences offers new possibilities to model more realistic genotype-to-phenotype relations in evolving populations, to build the underpinnings of a new integrative synthesis, and guide progress in plant breeding. In a novel virtual system that couples evolutionary genetic models (EGM) with crop growth models (CGM), we bridge a divide between models (and modelers) that: [i] simulate daily growth across a plants life cycle leading to phenotypes for emergent traits such as flowering time and yield across environments (physiologists, agronomists); and [ii] how selection can act on those outcomes to drive evolution and impact diversity (geneticists, breeders). As a proof-of-concept, we focus on flowering time, using a diversity panel in a high-throughput phenotyping plateform as a training population to incorporate the genetic architecture of flowering trait components into the EGM. New genetic parameters of virtual recombinants (outputs of the EGM) are then passed to the CGM to predict the flowering dates of recombinant inbred lines in different environments based on their genetic makeup, and those predictions are then compared to observed data. Our system highlights the need for specifically designed experiments to accurately estimate GxE interactions. We further investigate how 20 years of climate change is impacting maize flowering time in terms of variance components, leading to compressed variation in flowering time with potential impacts on the selection response. In turn, we explore how interactions between genetic architecture, recombination and parental sampling can determine the adaptive potential of maize to different environments under climate change.

## Abstract

Male gametophytes transport sperm cells from the anther to the ovule via pollen grain and pollen tube, reaching the embryo sac for double fertilization. The haploid nature of the gametophyte results in more direct expression of phenotype from mutation than in a diploid, with potential for subtle indirect effects on the final outcome: generation of a seed. For example, the architecture of the maize ear, with ovules at the base vs apex associated with silks of different lengths, raises the possibility that certain pollen mutants are associated with non-random effects on the spatial distribution of successful fertilization. In order to address this hypothesis across a large set of mutants, we have updated the EarVision computer vision pipeline, which identifies GFP-marked mutant and wild-type kernels from ear images, to both enhance its effectiveness and to output spatial information regarding kernel distribution. EarVision.v2 incorporates an ear scanner engineered for higher throughput, improved kernel classification across imaging conditions, and automated recognition of images that are unsuitable for computer vision phenotyping. In addition, it generates ear map files for each image, associating kernel phenotypes with specific spatial coordinates for downstream analysis. An R pipeline divides each map file into spatially distinct bins along the length of the ear, and assesses whether mutant transmission rates vary significantly across these bins. Our initial analysis of >80 GFP-marked mutant alleles has identified at least three alleles associated with non-random spatial outcomes. For example, the tdsgR102H01 insertion, which interrupts a putative actin-binding protein, conditions a reproducible apex-to-base gradient of decreasing transmission success for mutant pollen, consistent with impairment of pollen tube growth in the mutant. Expanding our analysis to additional pollen mutants should allow us to discern overall trends - e.g., how often are changes in pollen fitness associated with spatially-influenced outcomes?

## Abstract

Advancements in genome sequencing have revolutionized the study of diverse organisms by making it more affordable and accessible. Despite these strides, deciphering the intricacies of genomic structural and functional variation remains a significant challenge. Genome annotation is the process of inferring and modeling transcription and translation across the genome. Genome size, complexity, and diversity further complicate the annotation process. To enhance the speed and accuracy of gene annotation in plant genomes, we fine-tune a machine learning model called the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), which could help us translate the DNA language model. This method streamlines the gene prediction process, enabling the recognition of small peptides often overlooked by traditional tools. Our approach uses Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data from Arabidopsis to scan the genome and label the gene boundaries of the potential translation initiation sites (TIS) and stop sites. Applying GPN embeddings to a trial dataset containing 1.1 million potential initiation sites and 3.6 million potential stop sites in Arabidopsis showed a prediction accuracy of 92% in identifying the putative initiation and stop sites. This accuracy enables the precise location of genes and facilitates the identification of splice donor and acceptor sites. Finally, to validate the efficacy of the GPN in maize, we compared our model with existing gene prediction tools. Our findings showcase the effectiveness of a DNA language model as a valuable tool and resource for the plant research community. This work provides a robust solution for genome annotation challenges and significantly advances our understanding of plant biology.

## Abstract

Improving phenotypic prediction is necessary for more effective crop improvement and forecasting. This is especially true for crops which are to be grown in diverse environments and for traits with substantial gene-by-environment effects. Considerable thought has been devoted to improving phenotypic prediction by seeking to identify the best modeling approach including linear predictors, machine learning, and deep learning models. Here we explore a complementary approach to improve accuracy by using predictions from multiple models together in an ensemble. We demonstrate that an ensemble optimized by a genetic algorithm can reduce error by 6.98% relative to the best non-ensembled model. The optimal ensemble doesn’t consist only of the most accurate models but leverages lower performing models as well. This technique is effective even without significant optimization. In simple ensembles consisting only of two models we report an improvement relative to the base models in 76.76% of cases. While future advances in modeling approaches for phenotypic prediction are of key importance, this work demonstrates that ensembling can robustly increase the value provided by existing models.

## Abstract

Quantifying changes in transcript and protein expression in response to a specific biological process has been essential for the discovery of genetic determinants controlling the expression levels of gene-products. However, the role of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, has not been explored on such a high-throughput scale. Here, we integrated transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome measurements to map molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) and build predictive regulatory networks from Mo17xB73 derived recombinant inbred line leaf tissue infected with Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NLB). We detected 34,816 transcripts, 11,618 proteins, and 42,078 phosphosites and further mapped 34,056 transcript, 5,321 protein, 4,935 phosphosite, and 11,393 metabolite QTL. Novel genetic determinants of NLB resistance were validated using CRISPR/cas loss-of-function lines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of high-throughput mapping of multi-level molecular QTL and identify novel genes required for resistance to NLB.

## Abstract

Grain composition in maize grain plays a critical role in ensuring nutritious food supply and a variety of products that are important to the sustainability of human societies. As growing conditions become increasingly unpredictable due to rapid climate change, understanding the genetic basis of stability in grain composition is imperative. Despite previous research on the genetic and environmental factors influencing grain composition, the interaction between genotype and environment (GEI) remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive GEI analysis on over 500 maize inbred lines grown in five environments, for compositional traits including protein, starch, fiber, ash, moisture, and fat. In addition, we derived latent phenotypes to represent composition as a single holistic metric, and reduced bias due to genetic correlations. We assessed trait stability using a combination of parametric and nonparametric approaches that included Finlay-Wilkinson regression, AMMI-based models, and BLUPs. Our analysis incorporated a combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants, to investigate the genetic architecture of stability in composition using single and multi-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this poster, we present a summary of the genomic markers found to be associated with stability for single traits as well as with latent phenotypes representing composition as a whole. The findings from this study provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying stability in grain composition, paving the way for the development of adaptable maize cultivars with proper grain quality.

## Abstract

The Gramene project (http://www.gramene.org) played a crucial role in sequencing the first maize reference, B73, and more recently, the 25 NAM founders. The project remains actively involved with the maize community. Expanding on the Gramene and Ensembl infrastructures, the project developed four pan-genome subsites dedicated to individual crop groups: maize, rice, sorghum, and grape. In 2021, the maize pansite (https://maize-pangenome.gramene.org) was launched, hosting 37 maize genome assemblies, including three versions of the B73 reference, Ab10, 10 NAM genomes, and four European flint genomes. Each maize accession has a separate genome browser, facilitating gene-based views through text-based searches or BLAST. B73 serves as the reference assembly, anchoring gene expression, population, and pathway views. The site enables detailed exploration of transcript abundance across tissues and developmental stages, aiding in paralog expression analysis. Phylogenetic analyses rely on maize-centric gene trees, forming the basis for synteny maps and supporting rapid traversal between maize accessions and other species. The gene-centric views offer insights into allelic genes within and across species, gene expression, variation data, and lineage-specific expansions and contractions. Protein homology is visualized through amino acid alignments and gene neighborhood conservation. Community curation tools are deployed from the homology tab, allowing users to flag potential structural annotation issues. Recent work utilized gene trees to build a pan-gene index, enhancing gene structural annotation workflows. SNPs are easily viewed and filtered based on predicted functional effects and impact, downloadable as images and tables. Release 4 will include the genome teosinte inbred TIL11 and histone modification and transcription factor ChIP-seq data in parallel with transcriptomics datasets in five different tissues. In line with FAIR principles, standard identifiers or rsIDs will be assigned to SNP variants. The project continues to collaborate with the community for data stewardship, training, and feedback.

## Abstract

Understanding maize responses to environmental stressors is critical to ensuring a sustainable food supply in the face of climate change. Here, we first used high-throughput, image-based phenotyping to characterize the drought response of 46 inbred maize varieties. PlantCV, an open-source image analysis platform, was used to assess plant growth and color phenotypes and determine which varieties were most susceptible to stress. Next, we used weight-based phenotyping and the DiTech PlantArray system to demonstrate that varieties with more severe drought stress phenotypes have a higher normalized transpiration rate. The facilities and services shown here are available to both internal and external users at the Phenotyping Core Facility in the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center for high-throughput assessments of plant phenotypes under controlled environmental conditions.

## Abstract

Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is one of the major crops cultivated worldwide for food, feed, and fuel. With the high demand for maize production, it becomes imperative to improve the stress tolerance strategies in maize as increases in climate variability can limit maize yield. MaizeGDB has curated genes related to stress response and climate adaptability using transcriptome approaches to enhance the functional annotation of traits related to biotic and abiotic stresses. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling has been used to explain the gene regulatory mechanisms in other plants during stress, but such integrated studies in maize during stress still need to be explored in depth. We aim to identify the interplay between gene expression and histone modification in maize under stress conditions, building upon our previous expression functional annotation analyses. We accessed publicly available ChIP-Seq datasets related to biotic and abiotic stress generated from tissues of the B73 cultivar. The high-quality ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the most recent version of maize reference genome, B73v5. We will identify which genes are differentially associated with stress-response peaks, and correlate such genes with our previous stress-response functional analyses. Further downstream analysis will be performed, such as pathway enrichment and motif analysis. Our research will serve as a comprehensive resource for annotating maize stress genes.

## Abstract

The rapidly growing repository of plant genomes is opening new avenues in comparative genomics for gene discovery. This advancement is pivotal in the race to identify novel genetics in agricultural crops to mitigate climate change. This study seeks to leverage the evolutionary diversity in the Poaceae family to detect candidate genes that can enhance cold tolerance in maize (Zea mays). Cold tolerance would allow growers to plant maize earlier, avoiding late season heat risk and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. Initially, we assemble homologous proteins across species within the grass family using sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. A protein language model (pLM) then encodes the amino acid sequences into mathematical representations known as embeddings, which encapsulate their evolutionary, structural and functional characteristics. Finally, the embeddings are used to train a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a protein descending from a cold- or warm-adapted species. We expect that proteins classified as cold-adapted present promising candidates for introgression into warm-adapted crops, such as maize, to improve resilience and offset greenhouse gas emissions. Next steps will focus on validating candidate proteins via transcriptomic analysis and gene editing. Our focus on the Poaceae family not only aims to provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of cold tolerance but also to serve as a model for gene discovery for practical applications in other crops.

## Abstract

Genotype imputation is a valuable statistical tool used to infer missing genetic markers, enhancing the mapping resolution and power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The imputation of genetic markers are usually done by analyzing linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype information in a population. However, genotype imputation is not always accurate. In this study, we examine the accuracy of imputing missing SNP data based on the marker information of 509 maize inbred lines, which are part of the Wisconsin Diversity Panel. SNP and SV marker information for this study were obtained from the short-read whole genome resequencing data of the inbred lines. Specifically, we are focusing on the errors in imputation that occur due to structural variants (SVs). The imputation of missing SNP markers will be done using the IMPUTE2 program. Error in the imputation of SNP markers within known deletions specific to each genotype will be assessed. The false imputation of SNP markers within deleted regions could impact downstream power to identify marker-trait associations, which will be tested in future GWAS.

## Abstract

Genetic modification relies on identifying desirable genes within a related species. These relatives have historically been understudied for maize, with minimal genetic and genomic resources. Whole genome duplication events and hybridization have resulted in complicated polyploid genomes. This makes it difficult to both track and genotype genetic traits, and sequence and assemble their genomes. Recent decreases in the cost of sequencing and advances in long-read sequencing technologies have reduced these barriers for polyploids. These long reads can span tens of thousands of base pairs in length, and when assembling these reads into contigs, they often can reach highly repetitive regions that lead to assembly errors. In autopolyploids with low differentiation between homologous subgenomes, such collapse can even occur across both alleles and subgenomes. We developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that uses the gene counts and read depths to assign the DNA sequence into two states, collapsed regions and separately assembled regions. This will improve the utility of these polyploid genomes when mapping RNAseq or functional genomic data, as coverage and counts can be adjusted by assembly depths. We also anticipate this approach may also improve the interpretation of highly heterozygous genomes, such as outcrossing maize.

## Abstract

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common genetic variant used in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to explore genetic controls of phenotypic traits. Alternatively, GWAS can use counts of substrings of length k from longer sequencing reads, k-mers, as genotyping data. Using multiple maize traits, namely, cob color, kernel color, kernel oil, and leaf angle, we demonstrated that k-mer GWAS can effectively identify trait-associated k-mers derived from polymorphic genomic sequences of causal genes. The polymorphisms include a wide range of genomic variation, including SNP, insertion and deletion, copy number variation, and translocation. Our study also showed that the k-mer can play a bridging role in integrating omics data for identification of candidate genes conferring a trait phenotype. To enable the exploration of genomic variation among alleles of candidate genes, we developed a command-line package called Homotools, which was further utilized to create a user-friendly online tool http://tinyurl.com/maizegenomeHM. In this poster, we show the combination of k-mer GWAS and Homotools is effective to accelerate functional genomics studies.

## Abstract

Convenient and economical genotyping methods and simplified bioinformatic workflows are critical for genetic studies and breeding. The declining cost of short-read sequencing, innovative library preparation methods, and multiplexing have enabled low-cost, large-scale genetic and genomic studies. Here, we present an uncomplicated method for whole-genome skim sequencing and PCR amplicon sequencing with bioinformatics pipelines sufficient for various genotyping and gene expression applications. The method employed at Purdue, nicknamed WideSeq, costs $21 (USD) and provides ~100k paired-end reads per sample when performed at scale. Input samples for WideSeq can be genomic DNA samples or double-stranded PCR products. The lower data throughput from WideSeq permits bioinformatic analysis on a regular laptop or desktop, which can aid in bioinformatic training and introduction to genomic analysis for students and first-time genomicists. Using whole-genome maize DNA samples derived from multiple pedigreed populations, including advanced backcrossed progenies, mapping of dominant and recessive mutants, bi-parental populations, near-isogenic lines, and recombinant inbred lines, we demonstrate that this genotyping method can map loci, detect donor introgressions, identify haplotypes, and perform allele-specific expression. Mutants can be mapped as single introgressions for $21 or by comparing mutant and wild-type siblings for $42. Interestingly, we can even perform mapping-by-sequencing to detect donor genomes derived from parents of unknown origin and map classical mutants of unknown pedigree without prior marker discovery. Location can be further refined following haplotype analysis and re-calculation of allele frequencies. Further cost reduction in WideSeq could be achieved by implementing this strategy at scale and optimizing the data throughput sufficient for a specific experiment. This approach can be implemented using commercially available sequencing services at a moderate cost increase.

## Abstract

In genetics and genomics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly being used in new and transformative roles. These technologies can now predict and design protein structures, generate interaction networks, assign functional annotations, and decipher the outcomes of mutations. These outcomes provide new opportunities for model organism databases to use AI/ML for high-throughput analysis and knowledge discovery. However, it also provides challenges in integrating predicted and generative results with existing high-quality experimentally determined datasets. MaizeGDB has embraced these innovations, offering a suite of AI/ML-driven tools tailored for maize research. Some of the new resources include (1) the Maize Feature Store, a centralized repository formatted for gene-based feature utilization in machine learning applications; (2) PanEffect, a tool to visualize potential effects of missense variants, considering both the B73 reference genome and the maize pan-genome; (3) Protein Structure Resources with tools like visualize, search, compare protein structures. Furthermore, MaizeGDB has developed several methodologies for functional annotations. MaizeGDB now has an AI data center to organize and provide a central resource to find these tools and datasets.

## Abstract

Over twenty years of maize genomics research has created a large and diverse collection of high-quality data sets characterizing the maize genome. This has given rise to the need for specialized tools that allow researchers to integrate their data sets with publicly available genome annotation data as well as published community datasets. MaizeMine (http://maizemine.maizegdb.org), a component of MaizeGDB (http://maizegdb.org), aims to meet this need by integrating data from a variety of sources into a unified data mining warehouse. Based on the InterMine platform, MaizeMine provides an assortment of web-based search tools as well as an application programming interface (API) for programmatic access. The simple keyword search retrieves report pages for database objects such as genes and transcripts. Preconstructed template queries provide simple menus that enable users to perform complex queries integrating diverse data collections. The QueryBuilder can be used to modify template queries or construct custom queries. The List Tool takes an input list of identifiers that can be saved and used in further queries, gene set enrichment analysis and set operations such as union and intersection. The Regions Search Tool is used to retrieve selected genomic features based on chromosome coordinates. Query results are provided as tables that can be further filtered and exported in several formats, including tab-delimited, comma-separated, XML, JSON, GFF3, BED and fasta. The InterMine API libraries support programmatic access to template and custom queries with Perl, Ruby, Java and Python. We have recently developed API support for programmatic access to the MaizeMine Regions Search Tool using Python. Originally focused on the B73 reference genome, we expanded MaizeMine to encompass the maize pangenome based on B73 and 25 high quality Nested Associated Mapping (NAM) founder genome assemblies. Datasets included for each of the lines include Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, gene symbols and descriptions, and metabolic pathways using the E2P2 prediction pipeline. As the common parent to the NAM populations, the Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0 genome assembly continues to serve as the backbone for MaizeMine and is supported by a rich collection of supporting data sets which includes gene expression data from MaizeGDB’s qTeller, SNPs from Ensembl Plants, pathways from Plant Reactome and KEGG, Gene Ontology and protein annotations from Uniprot, protein domains from InterPro, and a collection of maize community data sets. Here we highlight those community data sets which include Uniform Mu and Ac/Ds insertions, transcription start sites from multiple tissues, enhancer regions, and an atlas of genome wide association studies. We invite suggestions from the research community for datasets to include in future MaizeMine releases.

## Abstract

Global warming is reshaping the crop growth environments and requires us to better understand plant responses to the rising temperature. As one consequence of global warming, heat stress can impact crop growth, development as well as the loss of grain yield. In the molecular level, heat stress can trigger gene activations in plants but molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Identifying genomic elements that are involved in the response process among varieties in one species can facilitate the understanding of potential genomic causal factors. We used maize as a model species to collect transcriptomic data in >100 inbreds and MNase-defined cistrome-Occupancy Analysis (MOA-seq) from B73 to understand heat response in maize. By developing a new eQTL mapping approach, we inferred hundreds of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) can be involved in gene regulation during heat stress and validated functions of selected CREs. This study provides insights on characterizing CRE functions in plant genome.

## Abstract

Bioactive compounds like tannins, polyphenols, and other antioxidants are becoming more popular, and sorghum has a significant diversity of these compounds, represented by different seed colors. Computer vision models have the potential to enable rapid, accurate measurements of seed color with lower cost and human labor input. However, to date, the majority of published applications of these models have relied on building and training models for specific crop species, requiring both large ground truth datasets and substantial computational and machine-learning expertise from the researcher. Here, we evaluated the potential of transferring previously trained and published models for rice and wheat grain phenotyping to new applications in a new crop (sorghum). The model trained on rice seeds was selected based on seed segmentation accuracy in sorghum and used to segment scans of sorghum seeds from 1664 unique plots from a replicated sorghum diversity panel field experiment. Three seed morphology and six color-related traits were scored from the segmented scans. GWAS for seed morphology traits, conducted using a subset of sorghum genotypes for which whole genome resequencing data was available, identified 23 trait-associated SNPs, a number of which corresponded to previously described QTLs for sorghum seed size. GWAS for seed color phenotypes identified two known large-effect loci for seed color in sorghum (y1 and tan1) as well as an independently segregating large-effect seed color locus near the y1 locus, which exhibited significantly non-additive phenotypic interactions with y1. The effect of the newly identified locus was validated via genotyping a set of 96 additional sorghum genotypes not included in the original GWAS study. These results illustrate the potential and challenges of transferring computer vision-based grain phenotyping from proof of concept studies to application in biological question-focused research.

## Abstract

Although a few species of bacteria have been studied in great detail, little is known about the characteristics of the enormous number of microbe-microbe interactions that occur on a daily basis in almost every environment worldwide. We have developed a simple and robust technique to set up the foundation for investigating pairwise bacterial-bacterial interactions, using cell-cell binding to identify possibly functional bacterial species pairs. We first isolated, sequenced and annotated a Serratia marcescens strain (SMC43) from Georgia soil to use as “bait”. Bacteria were then purified by their specificity in binding SMC43 that were attached to a wooden applicator stick. The microbe-saturated stick was streaked onto a plate containing bacterial media, and a few individual colonies were purified, while the whole stick-bound community was also examined by lifting the entire microbial growth off the plate as a mixture, and shotgun sequencing the DNA from this mixture. The isolated Microbial Partners (MiPners) were greatly enriched for previously undiscovered bacterial species, especially including members of the genera Sphingobium and Caulobacter, many novel. Some of the MiPners were unable to grow on the plate type tested in the absence of SMC43, suggesting an obligate partnership for those MiPner bacteria.

## Abstract

Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) have the potential to provide single gene resolution identification of candidate genes in plants and serve as a complement to Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, success in plant TWAS to date has been mixed. We generated a large expression dataset from 693 maize genotypes, measured in a common field experiment, and sampled over a two-hour period to minimize diurnal and environmental effects and using the full-length RNA-seq to maximize the accurate estimation of transcript abundance. TWAS analysis linked roughly ten times as many genes to variation in flowering time as GWAS conducted with the same trait data in the same population. The genes identified by TWAS included known true positive flowering time genes missed by GWAS, genes previously linked to flowering time variation in rice or Arabidopsis, and a modest number of genes without known links to flowering time but with plausible potential mechanisms. TWAS conducted using mature leaf tissue identified known true positive flowering time genes that act in the shoot apical meristem, and flowering time data from new environments beyond the one in which gene expression was profiled enabled the identification of additional flowering time genes. eQTL analysis of TWAS-tagged genes identified at least one additional known maize flowering time gene through trans-eQTL interactions. Collectively these results suggest the gene expression resource we have created can be reused to link genes to functions in determining variation in a range of plant phenotypes scored in diverse environments and expressed in diverse tissue types.

## Abstract

Studies have demonstrated that transcriptional heterogeneity within and among cell types contained within the same organ is biologically important but is not captured by sequencing of pooled RNA samples extracted from bulk tissue samples. RNA-seq analysis via single cell sequencing has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to paint a more detailed picture of variation in gene transcription, revealing complex genetic relationships in determining phenotypes in plants. However, the ability to utilize single cell RNA-seq may be hindered by the high cost and specialized technical expertise required to generate such datasets, resistance of tissues to treatment necessary for single cell sequencing and for some organs or species, the difficulty of accessing samples. We evaluated the potential of training machine learning based models to predict cell type specific expression patterns of genes from information on the DNA sequence of the gene and surrounding regions. We trained a custom built transformer model to predict cell specific expression of maize gene models using published single cell RNA-seq data from maize root tissues including nineteen labeled cell types. When trained on sequence data starting 2,000 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and extending 500 base pairs downstream of the transcription stop site, this transformer model was able to predict the expression of individual gene models across 19 cell types with accuracies that exceeded controls. Results show that the transformer model is able to predict cell type specific expression of gene models using their genomic sequence while also illustrating the importance of employing suitable benchmarks for evaluating the performance of ML-based predictions in the maize genome.

## Abstract

Modern maize breeding has significantly benefited from heterosis, where hybrids exhibit superior fitness traits, such as yield, compared to their parental inbred lines. A key aspect of this phenomenon is the role of deleterious mutations in reducing the fitness of inbred lines, highlighting the importance of deleterious mutation detection for Maize breeding improvement. Leveraging advancements in deep learning and natural language processing, we developed a convolutional DNA language model to prioritize deleterious mutations across the maize genome. This model treats each nucleotide as a 'word' in a self-supervised learning framework, akin to techniques used in natural language processing. Trained on genomic data from nine Poaceae species, including maize, spanning an evolutionary timeline of 49 million years, our model uncovered deep conservation patterns within the Poaceae family. After pre-training, the model was fine-tuned to predict conservation of both coding and non-coding SNPs, achieving accuracies of 0.82 and 0.95, respectively. Application of the pre-trained model to Maize haplotype 3 revealed that predicted deleterious mutations are enriched with rare alleles more than threefold compared to baseline. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our DNA language model in identifying deleterious mutations, offering substantial potential to enhance maize hybrid breeding by enabling more precise masking of predicted deleterious mutations.

## Abstract

Modern maize hybrids prolong the period that they photosynthesize and accumulate Nitrogen (N) out of the soil which has helped them produce more yield per unit of N fertilizer. However, the increase in post flowering activity is inversely correlated with N remobilization from the leaves. Further gains in N response could be achieved by breaking this association, but doing so requires an in-depth understanding of the temporal dynamics of maize canopy traits and plant N mobilization. Leaf nutrient samples were collected at five time points and remote sensing phenotypes were extracted from Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) imagery (orthomosiacs and point clouds). Spectral indices and point-cloud based metrics were used to investigate the relationship between changes in N storage dynamics and yield among hybrids grown in low and high N treatments. From these combined phenotypes, it is possible to dissect how rate of growth and canopy health help to describe hybrid response N and also provide clues for how to break the negative relationship between yield and N remobilization.

## Abstract

The advancement in generating high-quality genome assemblies from long reads has facilitated standard practices, yet precise gene structure annotation remains a formidable task. This challenge persists due to algorithmic predictiveness and inconsistent transcriptome evidence. A singular reference annotation inadequately represents a species' coding potential, while de novo annotations face sensitivity and specificity issues. Addressing the growing maize accessions, establishing pan-genes—encompassing gene models or alleles present in a species—becomes crucial. To tackle this, we developed a pan-genomic approach employing representative models derived from a comparative analysis of 38K gene family trees across 26 maize genomes via the Ensembl Compara pipeline. We identified 106K pan-genes, with 20% core, 66% softcore, and 14% shell genes. Additionally, we classified pan-genes based on taxonomic age.Core genes exhibited higher multi-exonic features, on average older in taxonomic age and mRNA evidence than softcore and shell genes. We propagated these pan-gene representatives to 26 maize NAM genomes using Liftoff and improved gene structures using full length transcriptome evidence via PASA. This approach increased average protein coding gene counts to ~60K across maize accessions, increasing sensitivity, enhancing annotations, detecting novel isoforms, and variants. The protein coding set had 33% core, 54% softcore & 13% shell genes. Utilizing the Gramene gene tree curation tool, we visually identified inconsistent gene models, flagging 272 genes for manual curation out of 1167 initially evaluated for B73 v5 models. We further open this curation tool for the community to explore flag genes that are problematic.

## Abstract

All plant seeds carry ectopic and/or internal microbes that can become a major component of the developing plant’s microbiome. Very little is known about the biology of the early seedling participants in microbiome communities in any organism or organ, including the root tissues of grasses. We used a time course of shotgun RNA and DNA sequence analysis of root samples taken from maize seedlings transplanted into a field on the University of Georgia campus to identify and quantify the changes ongoing during early stages of seedling development. These stages included replicates for 4 data points in the first 24 hours after these 14-day-old seedlings were transplanted into the field. Three different genotypes of sorghum were studied in parallel, to look for host genotype effects, and another set of identical experiments was performed at the same time with maize inbred B73. A huge diversity of microbes was detected, from all kingdoms of life, but a much lower diversity than seen in the surrounding rhizosphere or adjacent root-free soil. We will present analyses indicating the temporal, successional, functional, and host-species-specific processes that occur in this dynamic, complex environment.

## Abstract

All plant organs and tissues function in the presence of microbes, some with beneficial and some with pathogenic effects. Most plant-associated microbes, however, are not known to make any contribution to plant biology, at least partly because this question has been so little investigated. The least understood microbial component of plant root environments is the root surface, otherwise known as the rhizoplane. We have used “plating” of the washed root from maize seedlings to isolate bacteria that are associated with the rhizoplane but can be displaced from it by contact with agar medium. As a preliminary experiment, we purified ten independent bacterial colonies from an agar-plate imprint of a washed seedling root of maize line B73. These microbes then had their genomes sequenced by nanopore long-reach technology. Annotation of the ten fully sequenced genomes indicated that they ranged in sizes from 4,109,985 bp to 7,772,202 bp, and that a few were bacteria that we have commonly found associated with maize rhizosphere, like Pseudomonas glycinae. However, some represented genera that were not commonly found in the rhizosphere or endosphere, and even represented new species of well-studied genera like Duganella, Flavobacterium, Janthinobacterium, Luteibacter, Pantoea, and Sphingomonas. The majority of these rhizoplane microbes were enriched in chemotactic and/or flagellar genes compared to their closest relatives, suggestive of extensive mobility in the rhizoplane environment. Ongoing studies include analysis of the interactions of these microbes with the root and with other microbes in the soil environment.

## Abstract

In silico methods of predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that drive the plant immune response have been heavily studied in recent years to identify target genes for crop resistance. However, the PPI network between plant hosts and their pathogens is relatively unmapped, likely due to the limited data on known interspecies PPIs in current databases. The objective of this study was to overcome this obstacle by using recent advances in artificial intelligence, and predict interspecies PPIs between maize (Zea mays L.) and plant pathogenic fungi, Fusarium graminearum (ear/stalk rot disease). Firstly, candidate fungal effector proteins from F. graminearum were predicted using the computational biology tools EffectorP and SecretSanta. The binding residues of each effector protein were imputed using ESMBind, and RFdiffusion with Protein-MPNN were used to generate the structures of four potential proteinaceous binders. The binders were filtered by predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT), predicted Aligned Error (pAE), and root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d). Maize proteins which shared structural similarity to the binders were identified using FoldSeek. The interface of each presumptive PPI was then modeled in ColabFold, and the pair was retained if there was evidence for indirect/direct interactions between the two chain’s residues. The maize proteins were enriched for Pfam domains (i.e., Snf7, SNARE, pectin methylesterase inhibitor) and gene ontology terms that indicate the maize binders participate in vesicle transport, membrane trafficking, and enzyme regulation. Although the PPIs need to be experimentally validated, this study presents the framework for generating predictions of interspecies PPIs that can be explored for virtually any plant or pathogen of interest. Understanding these interspecies PPI could aid the development of control strategies that reduce crop disease or identify target genes for developing crop resistance.

## Abstract

Herbivorous insects in the order Lepidoptera cause massive losses to agricultural yields worldwide. One such species, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) causes the greatest damage to maize and exhibits host plant preference for Poaceae species. The beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) also feeds on monocots but is more commonly a pest on dicot vegetable crops. Insect feeding induces the accumulation of hundreds of metabolites in plants, however the regulation and biosynthetic pathways of most of these metabolites remain unknown. We compared the transcriptional impacts of two armyworm species on maize and the undomesticated grass green foxtail (Setaria viridis). This was done through a transcriptomic analysis comparing plant local responses four hours after herbivory from the monocot-adapted fall armyworm and the generalist beet armyworm. Results show significant transcript-level increases in plant defensive pathways, including jasmonic acid biosynthesis, jasmonic acid signaling, and secondary metabolic pathways such as indole-derived metabolism. Differences in defense responses between the two herbivores were investigated to identify genes with expression specifically affected by the monocot-selective fall armyworm. Comparisons between the two grasses show shared defensive pathways and divergent strategies between the domesticated and undomesticated plant hosts. Coexpression analysis identified genes with highly correlated expression patterns to herbivory-induced genes, implicating them with potential roles in defense response and regulation of secondary metabolism. These results help to further define herbivory defense in both maize and green foxtail for future investigations of plant-insect interactions.

## Abstract

Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), in chromosomal DNA, which are subsequently repaired to result in crossovers (COs) or non-crossovers (NCOs). COs occur when there is a reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. NCO formation, which is how the majority of DSBs get repaired, occurs through DNA synthesis, utilizing either the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome as the template. Chromatin environment is thought to play a role in controlling the distribution patterns of both DSBs and COs. Interestingly, there are indications that the chromatin environment of DSBs that become repaired into COs are distinct from the chromatin environment of DSBs that result as NCOs. We aim to identify the specific chromatin features that facilitate these two types of repair. To do this, we use machine learning (ML) to analyze high-resolution maps of DSBs, CO-intermediates, and COs. Understanding how the chromatin environment facilitates CO formation will help us design methods to control where COs occur in the genome.

## Abstract

Crop disease detection using traditional scouting and visual inspection approaches can be laborious and time-consuming. Timely detection of disease and its severity over large spatial regions is critical for minimizing significant yield losses. Hyperspectral imagery has been demonstrated as a useful tool for a broad assessment of crop health. In this study, we used off-axis hyperspectral imagery from entire fields, coupled with breeder-assigned plot-wise severity scores from a single growing season, to develop a machine-learning framework to detect and grade the severity of southern leaf blight infection in corn. We formulated a process that (i) enhances the predictability of assigned severity scores and (ii) assesses the interpretability of specific spectral wavelengths by surveying their connections to well-known biochemical processes. We implemented feature reduction methods, e.g., Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), L1-Regularization, and Sequential Feature Selector, with a focus on identifying the most discriminative wavelengths. These selected wavelengths were then evaluated using linear and non-linear regression-based models and quantified their effectiveness in identifying and grading disease in corn. The results showed that transforming the feature space with LDA achieves an R2 value of 0.72, however, accepting a reduction in performance (R2 of 0.57) enables the selection of wavelengths through L1-Regularization. Spectral content in wavelengths ranging from 500-550 nm and 675-725 nm have been identified as descriptive and correlate with the production of compounds, such as carotenoids and chlorophyll, highlighting the underlying biochemical mechanisms. Our results show that hyperspectral imagery offers the unique advantage of scrutinizing the intensities of specific wavelengths, allowing us to capture variations in disease grades and their progression. Furthermore, the development of hyperspectral field imagery and machine learning models hold the potential for broader applications in monitoring and mitigating stressors in various crops, thereby advancing food security and promoting sustainability in agriculture.

## Abstract

Meiosis is an essential reproductive process to create new genetic variation. During early meiosis, higher order chromosome organization creates a platform for meiotic processes to ensure the accuracy of recombination and chromosome segregation. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying dynamic chromosome organization in plant meiosis. Here, we describe abnormal chromosome organization in zygotene1 (ACOZ1), which encodes a canonical F-box protein in maize. In acoz1 mutant meiocytes, chromosomes maintain a leptotene-like state and never compact to a zygotene-like configuration. Telomere bouquet formation and homologous pairing are also distorted, installation of synaptonemal complex ZYP1 protein is slightly defective. Loading of early recombination proteins RAD51 and DMC1 is unaffected, indicating that ACOZ1 is not required for double strand break formation or repair. However, crossover formation is severely disturbed. The ACOZ1 protein localizes on the boundary of chromatin, rather than directly to chromosomes. Furthermore, we identified that ACOZ1 interacts with SKP1 through its C-terminus, revealing that it acts as a subunit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin/SUMO ligase complex. Overall, our results suggest that ACOZ1 functions independently from the core meiotic recombination pathway to influence crossover formation by controlling chromosome compaction during maize meiosis.

## Abstract

In the process of introgressing B chromosomes into the sequenced version of B73, once the B copy number was increased, we observed nine different trisomies and one haploid of A chromosomes among 69 seedlings analyzed via root tip squashes. A similar introgression of B chromosomes into W22 did not produce such an effect. The B73 results were somewhat reminiscent of the High Loss (HL) line described by Rhoades and Dempsey in which knobbed chromosomes break at the second pollen mitosis in the presence of B chromosomes together with the production of trisomies and triploids, although the B73 results did not show a high level of chromosome breakage. A study of the High Loss effects was initiated for comparison. When the HL line with multiple B chromosomes was crossed to an a1 tester, a high rate of breakage of chromosome arm 3L was observed given a large knob there. Also present were many defective kernels. A karyotypic analysis of kernels from this cross revealed triploids, monosomies, trisomies, fragments, and rearranged chromosomes. An examination of the pollen in the HL+B’s line revealed chromatin bridges between the two sperm and many grains with only a single sperm. Crosses of the HL+B line to tetraploid females revealed that the single sperm were diploid and functional in fertilization of both the egg and the central cell as evidenced by a higher frequency of normal kernels and karyotype analysis. An experiment with two-day pollinations suggested that the diploid sperm could be present in normal kernels due to heterofertilization. Progeny testing via self-pollination of the kernels of an ear from the a1 x HL+B cross found that all of the kernels that uncovered the a1allele in the endosperm had received the A1 allele in the embryo indicating that the sperm with the broken chromatid fertilized the central cell. Among the larger class of colored endosperm kernels from this cross, one might expect an equal frequency of semisterile a1 individuals that received the broken 3L arm in the egg. However, they were present at only ~8% of the reciprocal class. Two selfed individuals had ears characteristic of triploids, which was confirmed by variable numbers of chromosomes between 20 and 30 among the surviving kernels. Both kernel classes of colored and colorless endosperms from this cross produced some spindly plants that were sterile and are of unknown composition. Collectively, the results indicate that the nondisjunction property of the B chromosome at the second pollen mitosis can spill over to the A chromosomes depending on the background with W22, B73, and High Loss behaving differently. While the effect on knobs in the HL line has been known for some time, our results indicate that the centromeres of one or all A chromosomes might remain adhered at the second pollen mitosis to product the high rate of diploid sperm or A chromosomal trisomies.

## Abstract

DNA replication is a temporally regulated process across the S phase of the cell cycle. The timing of replication within the S phase for a specific genomic region is measurable and is referred to as Replication Timing (RT). Aspects of RT are relatively well characterized in animals, but considerably less so in plants. To fill this gap, our group has developed robust technologies to define and characterize the genomic and spatial organization of DNA replication in maize (B73 and NC350) and its close relative sorghum. We discovered that maize euchromatin exists in two distinct "compartments" that are distinguished by their replication timing (early versus middle S) and chromatin status as determined by DAPI concentration. This model is being tested to determine if the two euchromatin compartments are general features of the maize genome throughout the cell cycle. Two orthogonal assays are being used, one using chromosome painting oligos designed from RT classification and another using proximity ligation where intra-compartment contacts between same RT class sequences are expected to be enriched. Oligo FISH painting with RT-specific probes along a representative chromosome arm (5, short) revealed that early S replicating regions and middle S replicating regions occupy largely non-overlapping nuclear regions despite their extensively interspersed arrangement along the linear genome assembly. The early S FISH paint signals were in DAPI weak areas whereas the middle S FISH paint signals were in DAPI strong areas. These findings provide cytological evidence for our published "mini-domain chromatin fiber RT model", now also seen outside of S phase, in G1-stage nuclei.

## Abstract

Genomic imbalance refers to the more severe phenotypic consequences of changing part of a chromosome compared to changing the whole genome set. Previous genome imbalance studies in maize have identified gene expression modulation in aneuploids of single chromosome arms in both haploids and diploids. The modulation of gene expression in more complex aneuploids, e.g. monosomy of one arm and trisomy of another, has not been systematically studied in any organism. In this study, hyperploid heterozygotes of B-A translocations involving two different chromosome arms were crossed together. Then, by crossing these combination lines to a normal female stock, nine genotypes can be produced for each. These will have one, two and three copies of one arm with independent one, two and three copies of the other arm in each of the three genotypes for the opposite arm. For the kernel phenotype, the combination of trisomy + trisomy is easily identifiable phenotypically due to the enhanced smaller kernel phenotype, resulting from chromosome deficiency in the central cell affecting endosperm development. By examining RNA modulation, we discovered that cis genes on varied chromosome arms are generally more dosage-compensated in aneuploid combinations than in single aneuploidy even though some showed a clear dosage effect. For genes on the unvaried chromosome (trans), there is greater modulation in most of the aneuploidy combinations, leading to both reductions and increases in gene expression. The modulation in trans is more pronounced in double monosomy than in double trisomy, aligning with the plant phenotype, suggesting that a greater chromosome dosage change could induce more significant alterations in phenotype and gene expression. Ongoing work involves measuring transcriptome size in aneuploidy combinations that will help us understand whether the more dramatic stoichiometric changes of genes involved in protein complexes in the aneuploid combination would upset global mRNA transcription.

## Abstract

Synthetic chromosomes enable the engineering of multiple genetic pathways for large-scale genome manipulation. To ensure the faithful transmission of synthetic chromosomes, the synthesis of fully functional centromeres is indispensable. In plants, centromeres are not solely defined by DNA sequences but by a histone variant—centromeric histone H3 (CENH3). CENH3 plays a vital role in specifying centromere positions and loading of centromere machinery to direct chromosome segregation. In our previous work, we showed that an Array Binding Sites locus (ABS) containing LexO motifs inserted into maize chromosome 4 long arm (4L) can recruit LexA protein fused with CENH3 (LexA-CENH3). LexA-CENH3 replaces the canonical H3 and recruits native CENH3 to form centromeres. Centromeres activation at ABS loci transformed chromosome 4 into a dicentric chromosome and initiated Breakage Fusion Bridge (BFB) cycles. At low frequency, 4Ls were released and rescued by ABS centromeres (Neo4Ls) at the same time, demonstrating the functionality of synthetic centromeres. So far, we have screened fifteen Neo4Ls and transmitted them at least two generations without LexA-CENH3. The transmission rates of Neo4Ls can improve over time, possibly correlated with centromere expansion. Nevertheless, Neo4Ls still exhibit instability during plant growth, gametogenesis, or fertilization due to altered genome dosage, centromere-mediated chromosome erasures, or meiotic errors of single-copy chromosomes lacking pairing partners.

## Abstract

In the spring semester of 1974 at Indiana University, JB took Marcus Rhoades’ Cytogenetics course, which was the last time he taught it. During the course, Rhoades and his assistant Ellen Dempsey used numerous prepared microscope slides to illustrate various chromosomal variations. When Ms. Dempsey retired from IU, she took these slides with her to New York to live in Cornwall on the Hudson. In her holiday letter of 2011, she asked whether anyone wanted the demonstration slides and JB requested them, which arrived in 2012 in Columbia, Missouri. In the summer of 2023, LBK alerted JB that Barbara McClintock might have contributed to this collection. While at the University of Missouri, McClintock had offered slides to Rhoades in a letter dated January 30, 1941 after he had begun his faculty position at Columbia University in 1940 and would initiate a course in Cytogenetics. Later Rhoades moved to the University of Illinois and then to Indiana University. Upon searching through the many slides and their narratives, some were found to be attributed to McClintock. Patrice Albert took pictures of the cells on these slides, and we can match at least one cell to a sketch and photograph in McClintock’s 1934 paper describing the nucleolar organizing region (called nucleolar organizing body in the paper) (McClintock, 1934, The relation of a particular chromosomal element to the development of the nucleoli in Zea mays. Zeitschrift fur Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie). The match to images in this 1934 publication is definitive proof that this slide was used in the definition of the NOR. The affiliation of McClintock for this paper is listed as Caltech. The slide would have been prepared at Caltech by June 1933 when McClintock left and potentially taken with her to Germany from where she submitted the paper and then to Cornell where she returned before she assumed her faculty position at the University of Missouri in 1936. McClintock taught a course in Cytogenetics at Missouri from February to May of 1941. Beginning in the summer of 1941, she took a leave of absence to be a visiting scientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York City. Thus, at least, the slide journeyed from Pasadena, California potentially to Germany to Ithaca, New York to Columbia, Missouri to New York City to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois to Bloomington, Indiana to Cornwall on the Hudson, New York and finally back to Columbia, Missouri. The other slides attributed to McClintock by Rhoades also focus on the NOR, but the timing of their preparation is unknown, but probably before 1941. The quality of five of the six slides is sufficiently retained to obtain photographs as illustrated together with the narratives of each used by Rhoades and Dempsey. The Caltech slide illustrates the divisibility of the NOR by a translocation with different sizes of nucleoli. The other slides include microspore quartets showing alternate disjunction with and without recombination in the interstitial region as well as adjacent1 disjunction of translocations involving chromosome 6, the site of the NOR.

## Abstract

In addition to the A chromosomes, maize has a nonvital B chromosome that has been useful in genetic analyses in the history of our discipline. Despite being dispensable, it is maintained in populations by a drive mechanism. One of the components of the B chromosome drive is that its centromere frequently undergoes nondisjunction (probably due to the delayed DNA replication) at the second pollen mitosis, which produces one sperm with two copies of the B chromosome and the other sperm with no B. During this division, at least two trans factors are required for the unequal allocation of the B chromosome. Previous genetic analyses showed that an F-box domain containing gene Zm00044a000666 (“666”) on the tip of the long arm of the B chromosome is required for nondisjunction. The predicted function of this gene is to bind substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. To consolidate the genetic evidence, a complementation experiment was conducted by transforming 666-HA driven by its native promoter and then crossed with a B chromosome harboring a 666 deletion (previously recovered by CRIPSR-Cas9 mutagenesis). The resulting F1 plants were further crossed with the r1-r tester and the results showed that the presence of the transgene could complement the edited B chromosome for nondisjunction to a level of the normal B chromosome. To further identify proteins that might interact with 666, we collected mature pollen from three genotypes, including plants containing only the 666 transgene, those with only the 666 deletion, and those with both the transgene and the deletion. Then we used HA antibody to perform Co-Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We are currently analyzing the results of MS to identify proteins that interact with 666.

## Abstract

We have developed an engaging, flexible curriculum for teaching plant domestication and adaptation to students of all grade levels that meets numerous National Next Generation Science Standards. This activity, using miscellaneous craft supplies and a leaf blower, is both low-cost and easy to implement, and segues well into further lessons on plant science, Indigenous agriculture, plant domestication, plant breeding, and evolution. The activity is also really fun and makes for an engaging, dynamic learning experience that can be used at science workshops and in classrooms. The game starts with students designing, building, and testing seeds developed for dispersal in the wild. Next, students mimic the process of domestication by optimizing their designs to create seeds that are more easily harvestable. With our curriculum, students accomplish the following learning goals:Understand that modern crops were domesticated by Indigenous farmers 10,000 years ago.Learn that limiting plant seed dispersal was a large driver for plant domestication in response to farmers’ needs.Visualize that plants use multiple adaptations and methods to accomplish seed dispersal.Identify that traits can be selected upon, both naturally and artificially, and that plant domestication often selects for differing traits than natural selection.We have found that this activity gets students of all ages excited about plants and encourages them to think critically about the roles that domestication has played in our current food system. The entire curriculum (lesson plans, presentation, room setup guide, and supplies list) is available at maizegenetics.net/game.

## Abstract

How might plant geneticists have a broad impact on science education for diverse populations? Examples of outreach have included development of curricula and workshops for teachers, or support for underrepresented students to conduct laboratory research. Here we describe a different approach. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a “plant genetics unit” to be integrated into formal science teacher education coursework, with the aim of reaching diverse public school students through teachers. The unit focuses on the genetics of disease resistance in Maize and ethylene response in Arabidopsis. Both sets of experiments are conducted in parallel over the course of 3-4 class periods. We piloted the unit in two different teacher education contexts, with a small number of students (n=5; n=6). Students were teachers or student teachers in majority-minority school districts. We collected and analyzed students’ lab notebooks and responses to a questionnaire and recordings of classroom discussions. Both implementations presented problems that made the inquiry “messy”. In one case, Arabidopsis seedlings didn’t grow, and in the other, maize controls did not behave as expected. In the latter, the students discovered segregation of an albino mutation and shifted to understand the inheritance of albinism. Given the logistical problems, we recognize implementing this unit requires greater attention to optimizing conditions, and we are modifying the design to mitigate potential problems. Nevertheless, nine of the eleven students reported that the unit gave them their first real look into the “messiness” of science, and most valued such insight. This work raised questions about whether it is appropriate for adolescents (and/or teachers) to have an “inconclusive” experience with science before having a “positive” experience in which experiments work as expected. We propose that larger-N studies, in which we compare outcomes from conditions of “messy” and “clean” experiments, will provide greater insight into this debate.

## Abstract

The flow of nitrogen through the agricultural system is highly inefficient and leaky, resulting in the pollution of our waterways, excessive emission of nitrous oxide from our croplands and manure, methane from livestock, and carbon dioxide from synthetic nitrogen fixation, together accounting for 11% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture and the food system are projected to become the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. We argue that by shifting the use of synthetic nitrogen directly from croplands to livestock and human food, we can dramatically decrease this inefficiency. Furthermore, by lessening the nitrogen demand on our croplands, we can promote a circular nitrogen flow in the cropping-soil systems, paving the way for a transition that maintains high productivity while lessening environmental harm.

## Abstract

The USDA National Plant Germplasm System includes a collection of more than 20,000 accessions of cultivated temperate- and tropical-adapted maize and wild relatives from around the world. This collection is held at the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) in Ames, Iowa. Currently, approximately 75% of the collection (15,358 accessions) is available for distribution upon request and 82% of the collection is backed-up at the National Laboratory for Genetic Resources Preservation. Seed viability of distributable seed lot is monitored on a 5-10 year cycle. When viability drops below 50%, or if the number of kernels on hand falls below 1000, an accession becomes unavailable for distribution until it can be regenerated. Temperate-adapted material is typically regenerated in Ames, Iowa. Nurseries provided by partners and contractors in the US and Mexico are used to regenerate diverse material from unique environments. Seed regeneration is costly and can negatively affect the genetic integrity of an accession. However, it is also an opportunity to gather further observations. GRIN-Global, the germplasm database of the NPGS, currently holds 367,327 trait observations on 17,428 accessions, and 43,452 ear, kernel, and cob images on 16,804 accessions. Germplasm requests can be made through the NPGS GRIN-Global public website. In FY2023, 14,738 packets of maize were distributed by NCRPIS to requestors across the country and around the world.

## Abstract

Genome editing technologies have surged forward in biotechnology, revolutionizing scientific possibilities distinct from conventional genetic modification methods. This research conducts a comparative analysis of regulatory frameworks governing genome editing in Model Countries—England, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Japan—uncovering distinct approaches and developmental trajectories.Utilizing an exhaustive review of legislative mandates, policy guidelines, and scholarly literature, this study highlights regulatory nuances among these five nations. It examines legal structures, ethical considerations, and developmental timelines, emphasizing the growth and diversity in genome editing regulations.Initial findings reveal a spectrum of regulatory approaches, ranging from stringent frameworks necessitating comprehensive risk assessment to adaptable policies fostering innovation and safe utilization. Understanding these variations is vital for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders, aiding informed decision-making and potentially promoting alignment in global regulatory standards.This comparative analysis illuminates the dynamic evolution of genome editing regulations, offering insights into how nations navigate the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of this burgeoning technology.

## Abstract

Because of climate change, we have no other option but to feed our growing population with less land and fewer inputs. At Inari, we combine predictive design and an ever-deeper understanding of the plants’ complex inner workings with multiplex gene editing to drive improvements in yield and resource use efficiency. Our gene editing toolbox consists of technologies that enable us to turn specific genes off/on, tune their expression up/down and facilitate sequence replacement. Here, we demonstrate the use of the CRISPR/Cas system beyond traditional gene disruption, to upregulate gene activity. We identified a small element native to maize, that upon integration in target gene promoters enhances gene expression. Insertion into the promoter is achieved during non-homologous end joining-mediated repair of a CRISPR/Cas-induced double stranded break. Across all 11 target genes, insertion efficiencies averaged 29% (range 6%-61%). In all examined cases, enhancer insertions identified in T0 plants were inherited by the T1 progeny. Expression analysis in resulting T1 populations demonstrated increased gene expression in leaves for all targets except one and in primary roots for all targets; even genes with high basal expression could be further upregulated. As a proof-of-concept, we applied our CRISPR/Cas-mediated enhancer insertion technology to upregulate genes involved in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and performed small-scale phenotyping experiments. When grown in limited nitrogen, maize plants with increased expression of ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE, a cereal NUE gene, suggested higher tolerance to low nitrogen compared to siblings without the enhancer allele. Furthermore, we showed that the insertion of the enhancer element can be combined with other types of edits such as small insertions or deletions in other genes. To conclude, the Inari gene editing toolbox contains different technologies that can be combined to enable advanced engineering of complex traits, and to correct deleterious alleles to improve sustainable maize production.

## Abstract

Undergraduate research is arguably the single most important experience for inspiring students to pursue graduate school and STEM careers. Yet, most students never have the opportunity to engage in research simply because of time and limited institutional resources. Course Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) address these issues since students and institutions are already committed to classes. CUREs are not new to undergraduate curricula but they often occur as a singular opportunity as opposed to a curricular foundation,and therefore lack the impact of a prolonged research experience. To address this issue, we have developed a four-year CURE program that consists of eleven courses spanning four STEM majors. Students experience a breadth of research systems, questions, approaches, and analyses at every developmental level and the scale of the program ensures that a significant portion of every student’s education is research based. Here we present an overview of our CURE program and then illustrate how undergraduate researchers are helping to identify transcription factors that control leaf angle in maize. Leaf angle is an important trait that has historically been manipulated by breeders to increase planting density and therefore yield.Since the auricle contributes significantly to leaf angle, undergraduates helped perform a yeast one hybrid screen using the promoters of NARROWSHEATH1, LIGULELESS1, LIGULESS3, and ROUGHSHEATH1; all genes that are expressed in the pre-ligular band during leaf development. Surprisingly, all of these genes were bound by some combination of only four transcription factors in the Lateral Organ Boundary (LOB) family, including RAMOSA2. The small number of transcription factors identified as well as the overlap suggests that these four genes are in the same regulatory network and function early in auricle development. This finding illustrates how undergraduate education, CUREs, and discovery can be joined to the benefit of all parties.

## Abstract

Student retention in STEM majors is critical to meet an increased demand for STEM graduates within the workforce. Student retention challenges, particularly for underrepresented groups, often include barriers impacting student self-efficacy, persistence, motivation, and STEM identity. To address these issues and promote student persistence in STEM, the MARVEL (Microbiology Achievement through Research and Valuable and Experiential Learning) program was developed as an intervention to address these barriers impacting student persistence by fostering community, building confidence, and providing early experiential learning opportunities. Targeted interventions include embedding student participation in research symposia, experiential learning, and professional development-oriented workshops into the curriculum of a first semester majors’ course, as well as application and reflection of learning outcomes to students’ specific career preparation plans. Through participation in these activities, student confidence and sense of belonging increased as students saw themselves as part of a vibrant scientific community and able to network with other students, faculty, and staff with similar interests. Through the guided reflections, students also were able to connect the value of participating in these activities to their own career preparation goals. With continued participation throughout their academic programs, students will continue to build their confidence by developing a portfolio of professional development skills while networking and building connections to enhance their chances for future success in the workforce. The MARVEL program provides a model for other STEM majors and programs to promote inclusive access to professional development, experiential learning, and networking activities while fostering community and providing workforce development opportunities for students within their programs.

## Abstract

The Maize-10-Maze is a public outreach event representing the ten chromosomes of maize in a live field museum of select fun and famous mutants of maize. Positioned within a cornfield with a walking path and information placards, families segregating for dominant or recessive mutants are planted in chromological order in which each row represents a single chromosome with ~7-10 mutant families. Our most recent Maize-10-Maze was held in Tallahassee FL in the summer of 2023, and replicated at other institutions (The Danforth Center in St. Louis, MO; NC State University in Raleigh, NC). These chromosome gardens provide opportunities for training and educating the scientists and students who produce and host them. Here we report on the June 2023 Maize-10-Maze event, a cornerstone outreach event of our maize DNA replication project (NSF IOS 2025811). The selected mutants showcased visually striking phenotypes/traits or those with agronomic or scientific importance, such as Knotted1 (Kn1), lazy plant1 (la1), brittle endosperm1 (bt1), or teosinte branched1 (tb1). The site offered tours, either self-guided or hosted by FAMU/FACE students, and exhibited mutants with detailed placards (FSU 2023 placards & pheno-pics) containing links to maize genetics. This year, the Young Scholars Program (YSP) high school students added fun-fact centromeres to each chromosome. In collaboration with Florida A&M University's FACE Summer Program, YSP, and videographer Jonathan Doster, we created engaging digital content about maize mutants and plant genetics. Public access continues to be facilitated through various outlets, including a dedicated website, www.crazylazycorn.org, social media channels such as Instagram (@cornqueenb) and TikTok (@scienceforyall), online placards document, OMEKA (crazycornmutants.omeka.net/), a virtual mutant museum, curated by students for a worldwide audience. This project serves as a captivating opportunity for public engagement with modern maize research incorporating molecular genetics, genomics, and plant biology.

## Abstract

Native Maize Varieties (NMV) are adapted to their specific agro-environmental niche and local management practices. In México, NMVs are grown in a highly diverse set of environments, from hot and humid, to cold and arid, and, as such, represent an important resource to study the genetic basis of adaptation of crops to extreme and contrasting environments. Historically, the study of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in NMVs has been based on the use of biparental mapping populations or diversity panels. In this work, we present a Multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population generated with the genomic contributions of 8 Mexican NMV donors (MEXIMAGIC population) representative of the agro-climatic and environmental conditions where maize is grown in Mexico. A pilot set of 164 families of the MEXIMAGIC population were test-crossed with NC358 and the F1 hybrids were evaluated in a field experiment. 3 representative ears per row were scanned and the ear length, width, RGB spectrum (pigmentation) and perimeter principal component values were obtained from the images. Ear and Cob phenotypes were used as phenotypic input for Genome-wide association and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analyses. 5 QTL were identified in both analyses (alpha = 0.1): 2 for cob pigmentation, 1 for cob width, and 1 for ear width. In addition to the mapping results, we discuss the design, development, genotyping, and future expansion of the population. The identification of QTLs and their allelic effect works as a proof of concept for the potential of the MEXIMAGIC to dissect the genetic architecture of quantitative and agronomical relevant traits in NMVs.

## Abstract

Manipulating plant height is essential for crop improvement. Plant height was generally reduced through breeding in wheat, rice, and sorghum to resist lodging and increase grain yield, but kept high for bioenergy crops. Here, we positionally cloned a plant height quantitative trait locus (QTL) qHT7.1 as a MYB transcription factor controlling internode elongation, cell proliferation, and cell morphology in sorghum. A 740 bp transposable element insertion at the intronic region caused a partial mis-spliced transcript isoform with an additional exon, which contained a premature stop codon and led to a truncated amino acid sequence with an altered C terminus. Gene expression analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of qHT7.1 across development and along the internode position. The orthologue of qHT7.1 was identified to underlie the brachytic1 (br1) locus in maize. A large insertion in exon 3 and a 160 bp insertion at the promoter region were identified in the br1 mutant, while an 18 bp promoter insertion was found to be associated with reduced plant height in a natural recessive allele. CRISPR/Cas9 induced gene knockout in two maize inbred lines showed significant plant height reduction. The overall discovery enriched our understanding of plant height regulation in sorghum and maize, and enhanced our toolbox for fine-tuning plant height for crop improvement.

## Abstract

Nodal roots are the dominant part of the maize root system and are important for nutrient acquisition and physical support. Changes in nodal rooting patterns could help improve root system function, for example, the “Steep, Cheap, and Deep” paradigm posits that high occupancy nodes at, or just above, the soil line, but no higher, have benefits to efficient nitrogen and water capture. Rootless1, a classic maize mutant first described in 1930 and later mapped to Chromosome 3S, produces very few nodal roots aboveground. We previously identified a large indel in the promoter of ZmRt1 that reduces expression and which we hypothesize is responsible for the original rootless1 phenotype. However, an Ac/Ds knockdown allele of ZmRt1 named Rt1-2, was observed to induce supernumerary nodal roots close to the soil line before a precipitous decline at higher nodes which we hypothesize to result in changes in the root system, improving nutrient acquisition abilities. A comprehensive multi-year analysis of altered nodal root development and changes to root system architecture was conducted. A nitrogen contrast field experiment was performed in 2022 and 2023 comparing the Zmrt1-2 allele to the ZmRt1 wild type allele in high and low nitrogen conditions. Root crowns and 1m deep soil cores were taken to determine root distributions and root length density across the depth profile. Plants containing the Rt1-2 allele demonstrated changes in root length density, suggesting changes in nodal rooting affect root system exploration in the soil. Aboveground measures including biomass, total plant nitrogen, and yield were measured. Plants containing the Rt1-2 allele demonstrated higher yield in both high and low nitrogen conditions than the ZmRt1 wildtype allele, suggesting a positive influence on root resource capture efficiency.

## Abstract

Genotype by Environment interactions in maize have been extensively studied to understand genetic drivers of environmental adaptation, still many mechanisms of GxE remain elusive. The root associated microbiome (rhizosphere microbiome) benefits the host plant by increasing nutrient availability, growth via plant hormones, and resistance to pathogens. These benefits can be thought of as an expansion of the genomic and metabolic capabilities of the host plant. The plant microbiome is determined by host genetic and environmental factors. Many studies treat the microbiome as a phenotype of plants impacted by plant genotype and the environment. While this is useful for elucidating genetic and environmental factors that shape rhizobial communities, we argue the rhizosphere microbiome should be treated as a separate variable in determinations and predictions of plant phenotypes such as yield and resilience to climate stress. We propose a pilot scale experiment to address the hypothesis that the three-way interaction between maize genotype, environment and the rhizosphere microbiome significantly impacts maize stress tolerance while uncovering maize-driven microbial mechanisms of environmental adaptation.

## Abstract

The stay-green trait enables an extended photosynthetic period after anthesis which lengthens the plant’s grain filling period contributing to an increase in yield. This study was conducted to determine which hybrids stayed green for longer periods of time compared to other hybrids in the same location. Identifying hybrids that stayed green longer can give breeders valuable insight about which genotypes they should use in introgression efforts. At the end of physical maturity, optimum differences in canopy senescence can be observed. Once a week, plants were scored on a scale from 1-9 (9 being a full green canopy and 1 being completely senesced) and a senescence percentage (in increments of 5%) was recorded at the West Madison Agricultural Research Station in Wisconsin on 2 replications of 250 genotypes. In the 2023 growing season, disease was at a minimum and conditions were dry, equating to the ideal environment to observe senescence patterns. The selection of the top hybrids that stayed green the longest was based on the mean ratings from the last date measurements were collected. From highest to smallest ranking, the top hybrids were: PHK93 X PHP02, LH123HT X PHP02, PHK93 X PHP02, PHK76 X PHP02, and PHG35 X PHP02. All plants were completely senesced by October 27, 2023.

## Abstract

Advances in quantitative genetics and high-throughput pipelines have allowed for rapid identification of genomic markers associated with changes in phenotype. However, linking those markers to causal genes is still difficult, as many genes may be linked to one marker. We aimed to improve candidate gene selection by creating a new method that identifies conserved genes underlying GWAS loci in multiple species. Using this method with GWAS measuring elemental uptakes (ionomic) traits, we identified 14,336 candidates across Arabidopsis, soybean, rice, maize, and sorghum. Acquiring and homeostatically maintaining the cellular concentrations of elements are functions shared by all living organisms. Thus, it was not surprising to find that nine ortholog groups linked to GWAS loci across all five species contained the most likely candidate genes according to calculations using random permutations of the data. These 5/5 ortholog groups include seven orthologs in maize and thirteen in sorghum. Two ortholog groups have previously known elemental uptake functions, and the rest contain orthologs suggested to have previously unknown functions. We verified these predictions in the Arabidopsis orthologs by measuring ionomic phenotypes of T-DNA mutants and are identifying alleles of orthologs in maize and sorghum for similar mutant screens. Our methods highlight the conserved nature of ionomic genetic regulators and enable the identification of previously unknown ionomic genes.

## Abstract

Understanding maize genetic diversity has become an exciting research avenue that will result in new ways to add value to maize as a crop. As biochemical and genomic tools become more high-throughput and cheaper, research can answer questions regarding maize diversity. One such question is how diversity can be leveraged to make better food and beverage products that rely on maize as the primary ingredient. To answer this question, we are exploring metabolite diversity in heirloom varieties and in corn whiskey produced from these heirlooms, and using QTL mapping approaches to identify genetic loci controlling production of these metabolites. We developed a platform to efficiently produce new-make whiskey from small batches of heirlooms in order to quantify metabolites that contribute to flavor. Typically, current lab-scale methods require larger quantities of seed (on the order of 500 grams to 1 kilogram) to produce whiskey and are not optimized for low yielding heirlooms or non-elite populations. Our new method is a scaled-down version of the industrial distilling process that minimizes seed input (100g, or approximately 1-2 heirloom ears) while producing sufficient distillate (about 14 mL). This method mimics industry production in the US and is effective at producing ethanol at a genetics/breeding research scale. We have validated the method using ethanol and sugar quantification assays to effectively measure the success of anaerobic fermentation. This platform allows for further study of metabolic diversity in heirlooms and serves as a methodology for quantifying kernel carbohydrates for ethanol production in maize.

## Abstract

Free asparagine (Asn) is a critical nitrogen (N) transport and storage compound that can account for a large proportion of the free amino acids in maize kernels. While Asn plays a critical role in plant growth and development, excess N in the grain contributes to environmental problems as excess N in livestock waste can pollute waterways. In addition, when maize is prepared for human consumption, Asn is converted into the probable dietary carcinogen, acrylamide, during the Maillard reaction. For these reasons, we wish to understand the genetic architecture of free Asn asparagine accumulation in maize seeds. Ultimately, we seek to reduce the environmental impact of excess grain nitrogen and improve human health by reducing the precursor to acrylamide. There is genetic variation for both free Asn and protein content in diverse maize. This research aims to identify the genetic determinants of free Asn accumulation in maize seeds using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). Preliminary GWAS studies identified 421 gene regions related to Asn accumulation, while TWAS identified at least 95 genes. Interestingly, there were no overlapping association signals between GWAS and TWAS, suggesting that either different environments yielded variable results or that gene expression is not the only underlying mechanism. Beyond gene identification, we will use RNAi and overexpression of prioritized candidate genes to tease apart Asn metabolism (biosynthesis and degradation) in the plant and the grain. This holistic approach will inform strategies for manipulating Asn levels, balancing environmental sustainability and human health.

## Abstract

Breeding maize for increased grain yield has resulted in substantial changes in plant architecture-related traits, including more upright leaves that decrease mutual shading and provide increased tolerance to higher plant densities, altered plant height via altered numbers of nodes or lengths of internodes, higher harvest index, easier for machine harvest. High-throughput image-based phenotyping of whole plants used in prior studies either sampled destructively or involved greenhouse-grown plants, which may not match field-grown plants’ architectures. During 2021-2023, we have applied AI-driven image processing algorithms to extract multidimensional traits from field-grown plants imaged non-destructively using a Phenobot. Recent improvements to the Phenobot include attaching five tiers of stereo cameras to the Phenobot’s mast at different heights to ensure they capture the same plants' images, simplifying data processing. Custom-made strobe lights, which provide stronger illumination at a lower cost, were added to each stereo camera. Distance-based triggering of camera shutters was employed during the 2023 data collection, reducing the number of duplicate images as compared to our previous time-based triggering method. The Phenobot was used to collect the leaf angle data from the SAM diversity panel. The SAM panel consists of ~380 genotypes, which previous research established exhibit diverse shoot apical meristem traits [1]. Because the entire above-ground plant is derived from the SAM, we anticipated that this diversity in SAM architecture would be reflected in diverse plant architecture. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis. An analysis of a subset of the leaf angles of a subset of the SAM panel reveals diverse leaf angle patterns across genotypes. These patterns of leaf angles match ground truth data collected from destructively sampled plants. The long-term goal of this study is to understand the genetic control of the canopy-related traits and the effects of these traits on the efficiency of light interception by the canopy.

## Abstract

B73, developed at Iowa State University, is a cornerstone in maize research, embodying the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic population and contributing to the success of the Reid yellow dent maize group with its superior grain yield, adaptability, and strong stalks. Serving as a reference genotype, B73's stability and well-characterized genome have played a pivotal role in maize genetic studies, genetic mapping, and genomic research, particularly in molecular breeding and functional genomics, following its comprehensive sequencing under the Maize Genome Sequencing Project. In the absence of a thoroughly sequenced and well-assembled tropical maize inbred line serving as a genomic reference, B73 stands out as the optimal reference, even for tropical genetic backgrounds. We introduced B73 to Brazil through a seed sample generously provided by the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center. Two consecutive cycles of self-pollination were conducted in the summers of 2018-2019 and 2021-2022. Subsequently, seeds from each progeny were assessed for weight, area, diameter, and color, revealing a discernible difference in weight between B73-S1 and B73-S2. The seed size progressively expands across generations, as indicated by Feret's diameter, aligning with the observed pattern of seed areas exhibiting a similar trend. The progenies exhibit a subtle variation in seed color, although it lacks statistical significance. Abortive plants were observed in the field, though the frequency was not quantified. Our findings indicate that certain traits may exhibit variations across generations in response to environmental conditions and contribute to adaptation in tropical regions.

## Abstract

Root system architecture (RSA) is influenced by genetics, environments and agricultural management, thus understanding how these factors interact with each other is vital for root-based crop improvement. This study examined the impact of maize breeding, environmental variation and nitrogen availability on RSA through comparisons of root traits from a panel of era hybrids. Twenty-seven maize hybrids were selected from across four decades (1985-2020) of the Bayer Crop Science breeding program and planted a control fertilizer rate (200 lbs./acre N) and a low rate (50 lbs./acre N) at three different fields in Iowa, Indiana, and Illinois. To explore differences in RSA, in the summers of 2021 & 2022, we shovel-excavated 1300 root crowns at stage R3, averaging 6 samples per era hybrid at each N rate and field site. We generated digital 3D reconstructions using X-ray computed tomography and used a custom computational pipeline to further distinguish their overall contributions and impacts upon individual traits. From these reconstructions, we calculated more than 100 root traits in 3D such as total root length, total volume and number of root tips. Additionally, we measured the local climates, soil nitrogen, bulk density and water table depth throughout each season along with soil texture at each field site to better understand which environmental parameters were correlated with the changes in RSA development. Subsequent analysis shows that breeding, environmental variation and nitrogen availability all account for root crown phenotypic variation and we are working to further distinguish their overall contributions and impacts upon individual traits. These findings will improve our understanding of the heritability of root traits and the underlying genetics that control RSA development across a major US breeding program, which in turn can help improve future maize hybrids.

## Abstract

Teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, harbors a rich reservoir of adaptive traits that have been largely diminished during maize domestication. Recognizing the potential of these unknown alleles, here, we present the development and preliminary characterization of a new teosinte introgression population. The donor lines of this germplasm consist of 81 georeferenced teosinte accessions from different species of the Zea genus, including Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, ssp. huehuetenangensis, ssp. mexicana, Zea diploperennis, and Zea luxurians, with around 5-15 derived lines per most of the accessions. Evaluating the impact of teosinte alleles on agronomic traits is inherently difficult due to the differences in photoperiod and growth habitat of maize. This population, entitled “BZea,” addresses this challenge by creating BC2S3s with B73, creating derived lines with 12.5% of the original teosinte donors. Introgression into B73 allows for the evaluation of teosinte alleles in a maize background in temperate conditions. This also streamlines the analysis of agronomically relevant traits such as cold tolerance and disease resistance. To characterize this population, we conducted whole genome sequencing of 1400 of these derived lines with an average sequencing depth of 0.8x. We then used B73 as a reference for mapping to apply the hidden markov model (HMM) and identify the introgressed regions. We also performed a field evaluation of the population in the summer of 2023 consisting of 3 replicates of around 1200 derived lines and collected morphological, physiological, and photosynthetic phenotypes. Building on a wide sampling of teosinte diversity, preliminary analysis of the results indicates the potential of teosinte alleles to expand the phenotypic space of important maize agronomic traits.

## Abstract

Organic meat and egg producers must use organic ingredients in feed, creating a great demand for organic corn. We are developing corn varieties to meet the needs of organic corn producers. We test varieties in organically certified fields and select for characteristics that are important to organic corn producers. Breeding targets include agronomic performance, nutritional quality, ability to produce seed in the absence of herbicides and natural resistance to insects and diseases. In addition, we incorporate genetic systems such as Ga1-S that allows exclusion of unwanted pollen and SHGD (spontaneous haploid genome doubling), that confers the ability to produce doubled haploids without chemical treatments that are banned in organic systems. Our breeding program includes a rapid cycle method that uses doubled haploids and genomic selection to greatly reduce the time required to complete a breeding cycle.

## Abstract

Zein proteins dominate endosperm protein content of sweet corn and popcorn. However, zeins are deficient of essential amino acids such as lysine and tryptophan. The mutation in opaque-2 (O2) transcription factor that regulate protein formation in maize endosperm reduces the levels of alpha-zeins, thus increasing lysine-bound non zeins through proteome rebalancing. Building on insight gained from our previous Quality Protein Popcorn (QPP) project, this project aims to breed publicly available quality protein sweet corn (QPS) and colored QPP varieties. Modified o2 mutant maize, also known as Quality Protein Maize (QPM) were crossed to sugary-1 (su-1) and shrunken-2 (sh2) sweet corn verities and colored popcorn varieties. Colored QPP introgressions had progressed through selfing to advance to the next generation; backcrossing (BC) to recurrent popcorn parents to retain optimal popcorn background while selecting for vitreous kernel (modified) lines carrying the gamma zein o2 modifier gene. QPP lines are currently advanced to the final BC3 generation which will be followed by several rounds of selfing to generate inbred lines. Then the inbreds will be selected to produce QPP hybrids.For QPS breeding, F2 kernels visibly segregating for both o2 mutation and sweetcorn phenotype had been advanced through the F5 and had been selected for homozygous o2 mutation and field selected for sweetness and texture. In addition to protein quality, we aim to improve sweet corn micronutrient content and aesthetic appeal by breeding for color diversity. Therefore, sweet corn varieties were crossed to various color donors such as popcorn, dent corn, and flint corn and had been similarly advanced through the F5 generation with several rounds of selection for color, sweetness and texture at 20 DAP. Several standout QPS and colored sweetcorn lines have been identified and will be used in the production of hybrids. In the meantime, F4 and F5 kernels of colored sweet corn and QPS were collected at 20 days after pollination (DAP) and frozen for biochemical testing for sucrose, glucose and fructose, total starch, amino acids, resistant starch, and microbiome characteristics. Thus far, we have completed sucrose, glucose, and total starch analyses for both colored sweet corn and QPS and amino acids analysis for QPS is in progress. We will present summaries of our finds in the poster.

## Abstract

Optimization of root traits is a promising avenue for mitigating edaphic stresses such as drought, salinity, and suboptimal nutrient availability in cereal crops. Furthermore, crop root systems have the potential to contribute significantly to carbon sequestration to combat climate change . Significant variation for root anatomical and architectural has been found in major crops including maize, rice, and wheat. This variation can be exploited by incorporating root traits into the existing breeding programs. Here, we define a road map on “How to breed for root traits?”. First, we discuss the major hurdles breeders face when including root traits in their breeding programs, including the difficulty of phenotyping due to the underground nature of roots, high plasticity in root traits. Considering these difficulties, we describe 1) a selection of environment specific root ideotypes that includes both root anatomical and architectural phenotypes. For new trait discovery, the most promising germplasm, such as synthetic mixes, landraces, and wild relatives, can be used depending on the trait of interest. 2) We show the value of functional-structrual root modelling to explore the phenome landscape. We also emphasize a detailed physiological understanding of a trait, including tradeoffs, plasticity, pleiotropy, and phenotypic interactions. 3) We describe high throughput phenotyping platforms such as shovelomics, anatomics, and LEADER (leaf elemental accumulation for deep roots) to phenotype the root traits of interest and integration of these protocols into genomic prediction models. Furthermore, we describe the use of potential proxy traits which can be used estimate complex root functions like rooting depth. As a proof of concept, we discuss successful examples of breeding for root metaxylem vessel area in wheat and root hairs in common beans. We also describe a program we are establishing to select on roots traits in maize.

## Abstract

Maize is the number one production crop in the US and globally, supporting the global food supply as well as portions of the energy system. Nitrogen fertilizer is the largest energy input for maize, and excess nitrogen results in water pollution and contributes 6% of the entire US GHG (55% of agricultural emissions) through nitrous oxide release. To ensure the sustainability of agricultural systems, improvements to genetics and management practices that would minimize maize’s contributions to climate change and water pollution are necessary. A team of scientists from across the US is working together to start solving this problem. Their research aims to create a Circular Economy that Reimagines Corn Agriculture (CERCA) - converting maize to an earlier season annual with reduced environmental impacts through increased uptake and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer. The team is organized in three highly integrated activities: (1) Modeling of plants, farms, environments, and economics to determine the most important combinations of traits and environments likely to benefit from new cropping systems. (2) Trait Discovery through evaluation of related wild species and maize landraces that recycle nutrients and have some cold tolerance. (3) Trait Development through stacking and testing of genetic improvements predicted to have substantial impact. This project is starting with seven native trait concepts focused on greater on-farm nutrient recycling: nitrogen remobilization to roots, reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus in the kernel, biological nitrification inhibition, germination and seedling cold tolerance, and seedling establishment in cool temperatures. CERCA reimagines the cycle of planting and fertilization without changing most of the existing equipment and processes, thus making adoption more likely and efficient.

CIMMYT Maize Lines (CMLs): A Fundamental Resource for Maize Breeders and Geneticists Alejandro Velazquez, Alberto Chassaigne, Cristian Zavala* ¹CIMMYT Int., j.velazquez@cgiar.org, ¹CIMMYT Int. a.chassaigne@cgiar.org, ¹CIMMYT Int. c.zavala@cgiar.org. CIMMYT Maize Lines (CMLs) are a carefully curated collection of 647 elite lines, actively developed by the CIMMYT Global Maize Program since 1991. These lines represent a widely utilized resource of freely available, elite germplasm for both public and private sector maize breeders worldwide. Since 2005, the responsibility for the conservation, regeneration, and distribution of this crucial genetic resource has resided with the CIMMYT Maize Germplasm Bank (BGM). Notably, CMLs constitute the most frequently requested accessions within the BGM collection, requiring more frequent regeneration cycles. Over the past five years, the CIMMYT BGM has forged collaborations with over 100 national institutions, public and private sectors, along with independent producers and universities. These collaborations have addressed all seed requests emanating from the BGM collection, of which more than 50% were for CMLs. Within the framework of the MasAgro-Biodiversity Seed of Discovery (SeeD) Project, we are engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of the genetic diversity encompassing all 27,500 maize, teosinte, and tripsacum spp. accessions housed within the BGM. This endeavor aims to culminate in the development of a comprehensive molecular atlas of maize. Such an atlas holds immense potential to enhance our understanding of maize genetic resources, encompassing landraces alongside advanced and elite breeding lines. Ultimately, this will facilitate the selection, utilization, and further research involving these valuable materials. Genotyping serves as the cornerstone of data unification, critical for its subsequent use in constructing molecular atlases. Concurrent with the BGM accession genotyping evaluations, a more in-depth assessment of CMLs was conducted. This assessment aimed to detect any potential divergence between the original seed received by the BGM in 2005 and subsequent regenerations. Additionally, the objective was to establish a standardized genetic fingerprint for routine quality control analyses. This will ensure the unwavering purity of each CML line following each seed increment or regeneration cycle. The present work details the outcomes of this analysis and its subsequent application in the development of a CML genotyping platform.

## Abstract

Hybrid yellow dent maize has stood the test of time on the domestic and international markets, generating billions of dollars for fuel and livestock feed. Open-pollinated maize heirlooms (landraces) are incredibly genetically diverse, both between and within populations, and harbor unique alleles not present in modern cultivars that have experienced intense directional selection. Historically, heirlooms were grown throughout the world for subsistence farming and livestock feed before the advent of modern hybrids. Heirlooms are prized in niche markets, with smallholder farms, chefs, and organic farms interested in their unique and broad culinary applications. Heirlooms from other countries have been intensively studied, with extensive monographs written about landraces from Mexico, South America, Asia, and Europe; however, there is no monograph from the United States. Data that does exist for US heirlooms is largely incomplete and lacks defined population structures based on phenotypic and genetic data. This project will systematically characterize about 1000 heirlooms, representing most of the open-pollinated varieties from the US and Canada held in the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station. Manual and unmanned aerial vehicle technologies will be used to collect plant architectural traits, and a digital imaging pipeline will measure ear and kernel morphologies, with emphasis on end-use traits. Near-infrared spectroscopy will assess kernel composition traits, including starch, protein, and oil. Pool-seq technology will be used to genotype 500 heirlooms, which represent a large portion of the genetic diversity present in the set. Genetic data will provide insight into the population structure of heirlooms with similar names and morphologies, delineating natural groupings within the set. Subsequent GWAS integrating historical weather, phenotypic, and genotypic data will identify genes involved in adaptation and morphology. Ultimately, this project will produce a publicly available, comprehensive data set describing US heirlooms and the genetics involved in adaptation and quality-related traits.

## Abstract

Maize production continues to grow towards the northern portions of the US Corn Belt. Cold tolerance during germination and seedling establishment poses challenges in those regions that experience cold temperatures in early spring. Optimizing strategies for maize production is crucial for sustainable agriculture. This study aims to improve maize seedling establishment and tolerance as key components of a strategy to extend the growing season to support greater light interception and higher dry matter accumulation.This research focuses on evaluating the cold resistance of seedlings from four biparental mapping populations including 250 double haploids (DH) from a six parent Stiff Stalk MAGIC population, 74 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross of Gaspe and B73, 130 RILs from P39 by B73 and 181 from B97 by B73. The evaluation also included 63 maize landraces adapted to altitudes above 2500 m. The experiment, designed as a randomized complete block design, comprised single row plots with 20 seeds per plot and two field replicates and it was planted in September at the West Madison Ag Research Station in Madison, Wisconsin to impose cold conditions during seedling growth. The phenotypic evaluation included seedling cold tolerance and regrowth after a cold episode, rating seedling growth in a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 show yellowed and weak plants and 4 green and vigorous. The evaluation also included a drone-based assessment of different parameters such as growth indicators, parallel evaluation of growth stages, with a classification of cold response after two cold episodes (40° F and 30° F). The results of this study are expected to contribute to the optimization of maize production strategies in cold climates to improve seedling establishment, cold germination, and tolerance, thus extending the growing season and promoting higher light interception and dry matter yield in maize.

## Abstract

Structural variants play an important role in adaptation and evolution. Those polymorphic regions can influence gene expression, epigenetic marks, and, consequently, the phenotype. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are commonly used to find candidate genes associated with a trait of interest in polyphonic regions. However, we hypothesize that the SNP-based GWAS may miss important genomic regions associated with structural variation (SV) types when the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is not in linkage disequilibrium with the causal SV variant. An alternative approach is to use short sequences, k-mers, as variables in the GWAS analysis. Here, we compare k-mer-based and SNP–based GWAS approaches to find candidate genes associated with important traits in sweet corn. We used ~9X coverage whole-genome short reads from a sweet corn panel with 693 genotypes to build a presence/absence (PAV) table based on k-mers and call SNP variants. The population was phenotyped for a variety of traits measured across three years. The k-mer-based pipeline begins performing the k-mer occurrence count (KOC) of 31 bp from the raw sequences for each individual. After the filtering steps, a k-mer presence/absence table was created to represent the genetic diversity in the population. GWAS analysis was conducted using a linear mixed model (LMM) in GEMMA, with k-mers filtered for minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.05. For the SNP-based GWAS approach, we called variants using GATK and obtained a VCF with 16M SNPs. Overall, we found that for some traits, the k-mer-based approach was more effective at identifying significant genomic regions. Additionally, for some traits, the k-mer-based GWAS was more consistent across years of data for the same trait. However, a disadvantage of the approach is that the pipeline is significantly more time-consuming and computational-intensive.

## Abstract

Inadequate absorption of micronutrients, termed “hidden hunger,” impacts more than half of the global population. Those predominately affected rely on staple crops for their caloric intake, which are often low in bioavailability of the micronutrients needed. Iron, zinc, and provitamin A, the predominately lacking micronutrients, have been extensively researched to facilitate biofortification, a plant breeding method that exploits biosynthetic metabolic processes to increase the concentration of nutrient-value components. However, an evaluation for these key value-adding traits has not been thoroughly studied within the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) Project germplasm pool. Whereas commercial hybrid varieties have been selected for high-yielding traits, the exotic donor germplasm utilized by GEM has been historically bred for edible traits, thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering impactful variation for introgression into the corn industry. Two doubled haploid (DH) populations were derived from double-double synthetic crosses to encapsulate the genetic diversity within GEM that represent the two major Corn-Belt heterotic groups. DH lines will be genotyped using a low-density genotype-by sequencing strategy, while double-double cross founder lines will be genotyped using high-density genome sequencing. This approach will allow for imputation with improved accuracies. DH lines will be phenotyped for (1) macromolecular composition using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), (2) provitamin A carotenoid concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), (3) mineral concentrations using inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and (4) antinutrient concentrations for bioavailability assessments. This study will combine genotypic data with phenotypic data in an optimal training populations approach to identify lines superior in value-added traits within GEM.

## Abstract

The increased genetic load resulting from the cost of domestication and the limited founding parental lines impedes the continuous improvement of U.S. temperate maize germplasm, particularly in the context of climate change. To enhance genetic diversity and mitigate the genetic load, the USDA-funded Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) program aims to leverage tropical alleles for enhancing temperate genetic materials. In this study, we conducted a replicated field experiment under low and high N field conditions over three consecutive years to evaluate the effect of tropical alleles of GEM materials in responding to different nitrogen (N) conditions. From the field experiments, we collected conventional phenotypic traits, including six yield-related and seven belowground root traits, as well as rhizosphere microbial traits from a Backcrossed GEM (BGEM) inbred panel and the hybrids generated by crossing BGEM inbreds with two tester lines, B73 and Mo17. Our results reveal that BGEM hybrids consistently outperform inbreds for conventional phenotypic traits under both N conditions. Interestingly, microbial traits generally display lower abundance and diversity in hybrids than inbreds under high N conditions. However, under low N conditions, about half of the microbial traits exhibit heterosis. To uncover the genetic basis of trait per se, heterosis, and the transformed N-responsive traits, we conducted Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) and identified a number of favorable tropical alleles, some of which contributed to heterosis of conventional or microbial traits and associated with N-responsive traits. The insights gained from this study can potentially contribute to developing N-resilient maize varieties by leveraging host-microbe symbiosis in future maize breeding.

## Abstract

One way to achieve sustainably high crop yields is by planting cultivars with reduced height. The major beneﬁt of this trait stems largely from the ability of short plants to resist lodging, thereby allowing the adoption of optimal management approaches to maximize yields. The signiﬁcance of the impact that this trait has had on crop productivity is best exempliﬁed by the development of dwarﬁng varieties of wheat and rice in the late ‘60s, which led to an era of food suﬃciency, commonly referred to as Green Revolution. Since then, the dwarﬁng trait has become a staple for most cereal crops. However, there has been one gaping exception. Corn! While it was neither due to the lack of intent nor eﬀort to exploit this trait in corn, dwarﬁng failed to be tamed to generate commercially viable hybrids. The reason: it is not as straightforward as one may think to develop short cultivars in a hybrid crop. A major bottleneck is the lack of a suitable dwarfing trait that should preferably be dominant with negligible impacts of genetic background and heterosis. That said, it is exciting to announce that we have finally found one such mutant that has the potential to transform maize production worldwide. Named D16, it was generated by chemical mutagenesis with EMS. D16 is partially dominant, and it compresses plant height by 2-3 feet in all corn hybrids tested. The impact on yield appears to be positive also. D16 is caused by a unique point mutation that had never been reported in any plant species. D16 can be bred in maize by both conventional and gene editing (GE) approaches. The advantage of GE is that it will allow the D16 trait to be extended to other crops as well.

## Abstract

Introducing favorable alleles into commercial crop germplasm is time consuming and costly. Two technologies that are disrupting maize breeding are doubled haploids (DH) and genome editing (GE). Recently, DH and GE were combined into HI-Edit TM, a method in which a haploid inducer (HI) line is transformed with a CRISPR cassette to deliver an edit to any maize variety in a single cross, obviating recurrent selection and linkage drag from trait introgression. HI can be achieved through maternal HI system triggered by mutations of MTL/ZmPLA1/NLD, and paternal HI system through engineered CENTROMERIC HISTONE3 (CENH3). Typically, HI lines are less amenable to transformation given their aberrant reproductive characteristics. For HI-Edit TM to operate at commercial scale, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and transformable HI lines. Leveraging marker assisted selection for HI genes (matl, dmp, R1, and C1) and four generations of phenotyping, we developed maternal MATL HI lines in Iodent and Stiff Stalk germplasm with a combination of high transformability, HI performance, and a dominant anthocyanin embryo marker for haploid identification. In addition, a new paternal CenH3 HI line bred with color marker was developed in Stiff Stalk germplasm showing desirable performances in transformation frequency and HI. These results may facilitate the development of commercially scalable HI-EditTM for maize and other crops.

## Abstract

Phosphorus(P) is an important nutrient in fertilizers which is essential for plant growth and development. Excessive use of P-rich fertilizers leads to leaching and runoff to water bodies harming aquatic life. The limited global reserves of rock P and water pollution make it necessary to find a sustainable solution that ensures the proper utilization of P. Landrace varieties adapted in soils with varying P levels likely possess unique genetic mechanisms to cope with P scarcity. Environmental Genome-Wide Association Studies(eGWAS) using these genotypes with georeferenced accessions, present a potential for identifying candidate genes. Employing eGWAS, we seek to identify candidates associated with P that overcomes these obstacles. Central to GWAS's success is accurate phenotype measurement. To this end, we have developed a Random Forest model predicting P availability surpassing current models in prediction accuracy and capability to discern lower-end values. Utilizing genetic datasets of maize and sorghum, we will conduct eGWAS using our new P data. The maize dataset specifically has gone through Practical Haplotype Graph imputations, increasing its resolution. We will use a linear regression based p-value combination method to aggregate multiple small effects on a gene-based level. This study will also investigate the role of lipids in sorghum's adaptation to P levels in Africa, drawing comparisons with our previous study that identified lipid variations in maize adapted to low P in the Mexican highlands. Additionally, we have obtained lipid profiles for 400 Sorghum Association Panel grown in high and low P. Analyzing their lipid dynamics will play a significant role in understanding P utilization. Subsequently, a GWAS will be conducted focusing on these identified candidate lipids. Using the Cauchy Combination test to combine the findings from both the P GWAS and lipid GWAS, we aim to redefine the order of gene importance and identify candidates linked to both phenotypes.

## Abstract

Within Mexican territory alone, the tireless efforts of generations of farmers have produced 50+ recognized varieties of native maize, adapted to elevations from sea level to well over 3,000 m and environments ranging from semi-desert to the hot, humid tropics. As maize dispersed, it was the roots that most directly faced many challenges posed by new environments. While the diversity of ear morphology readily illustrates the richness of Mexican maize, below-ground traits may be of greatest importance in developing maize varieties for future climates. Here, we present high-throughput root phenotyping approaches that are beginning to provide a picture of the variation in root system architecture and root anatomy to be found in Mexican native maize. We introduce a novel multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross mapping population for Mexican native maize (MEXIMAGIC) and illustrate its application in testing adaptive hypotheses. Following the development of test cross-families developed using eight parent families, the root systems of 169 F1 families were evaluated in a common garden field experiment, allowing for the identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for root system width, nodal root number, and lateral root density. Parsing QTL alleles to their respective founders reveals substantial variation in the parental allele effects, displaying diverse phenotypes. Further analysis of these allele effects paired with climate variables describing the native climate of the eight founders allows for the additional identification of putative signals of local adaptation. These adaptive QTL present building blocks for developing maize varieties displaying root systems conferring resistance to abiotic stresses. With more than 500 families, continued use of the MEXIMAGIC population will provide substantial power to identify QTL at a higher resolution. Further evaluations in multiple soil environments will provide additional information into the adaptive potential of parental alleles responsible for root traits conferring resilience in the face of climate change.

## Abstract

Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is a viral disease caused by host co-infection by maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a potyvirus, such as sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). This disease is most effectively managed by growing MLN resistant varieties, although the relative importance of MCMV versus potyvirus resistance in managing this synergistic disease is poorly characterized. Here, we explore the impact of host resistance to SCMV and/or MCMV infection on plant disease, virus titer, and synergism during co-infection. In addition to visual assessment of disease progress, we used qRT-PCR to quantify relative virus titer and expression of known potyvirus resistance genes TrxH and ABP1. MLN disease was significantly lower in both the MCMV resistant (N211, CML333, and KS23-6) and SCMV resistant (Pa405) inbred lines, compared to the susceptible control Oh28. Only Pa405 sustained resistance to SCMV in both treatments, though both CML333 and KS23-6 had reduced SCMV titer throughout MLN infection. Despite no visible presence of disease, MCMV titers in N211 were not significantly different from susceptible controls by 14 days post inoculation. Initial TrxH expression was up to 49,000-fold lower in Oh28 compared to other genotypes, while expression of ABP1 was up to 4.5-fold lower. Measures of virus synergy indicate that while MCMV resistance is effective in early infection, strong potyvirus resistance is critical for reducing synergist effects of co-infection on MCMV titer. These results emphasize the importance of both potyvirus resistance and MCMV resistance in an effective breeding program for MLN management.

## Abstract

Increasing the number of plants per acre has been an effective means for achieving higher overall maize grain yield, but planting at densities above certain thresholds can have detrimental effects on maize plants, including ear barrenness and increased stalk and root lodging risk. Furthermore, altering planting density adds costs to producers via greater expenditures on seeds and fertilizer to attain target planting densities and satisfy higher demand for nutrients, ultimately reducing the return on investment. Efforts are needed to identify effective methods for increasing maize grain yield after maximum planting rates have been reached by increasing yield per plant. We hypothesize that maximizing light interception through optimum combinations of canopy architecture and plot orientation is one such method. Here, we utilized a split-plot design to investigate twenty maize testcross hybrids with distinct leaf angle architectures (flat, upright, or dynamic), with two replications of two-row plots at two locations in Iowa, USA. At each location, plots were planted either parallel or perpendicular to the general position of the sun. Data were collected for root and stalk lodging, ear barrenness, light interception forty days after planting and at flowering, multiple leaf angles per canopy type, grain moisture, and grain yield. Our findings indicate altering plot orientation does affect light interception, an important determinant of maize grain yield. Identifying leaf angle and plot orientation combinations that optimize light interception may provide producers with a means for increasing overall maize grain yield.

## Abstract

Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is a pivotal factor in modern agriculture, significantly boosting crop yields. While extensive research has delved into genetic and environmental influences on heterosis, the microbial role remains poorly understood. This study investigates the intricate relationship between maize plants and their associated microbial communities, unveiling the microbial impact on heterosis. Our approach involved using a simplified synthetic community (SynCom) of seven bacterial species assembled by maize plants. We evaluated the individual and collective capacity of each bacterial species to induce heterosis across four maize genotypes—two inbreds (B73 and Mo17) and their hybrids (B73 x Mo17 and Mo17 x B73). To achieve this, surface-sterilised maize seeds were pregerminated and inoculated with individual bacterial species or SynCom and grown gnotobiotically. Results revealed that heterosis was more pronounced in the shoots and roots of the uninoculated control, while it manifested solely in the roots of the SynCom treatment. Moreover, heterosis effects in both shoots and roots were more influenced by some individual microbes within the SynCom than by others. Future experiments aim to establish multiple iterations between heterosis inducers and non-inducers, exploring potential microbe-microbe influences on maize plant heterosis. This research not only broadens our comprehension of plant-microbe interactions but also holds significant promise for leveraging microbial communities to sustainably optimize maize productivity.

## Abstract

Phenomic Selection (PS) is a low-cost alternative to Genomic Selection (GS) for enhancing genetic gains in breeding programs. That new technique maintains the statistical procedure used in GS-based prediction models but replaces the molecular markers data (e.g. SNP data) with variables obtained from a multi-variate phenotyping method (e.g. near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data). This study aimed to explore the application of PS using single kernel NIR in a sweet corn breeding program, focusing on predicting field-based traits of economic importance, including ear and vegetative characteristics. First, on a diversity panel, three models were employed: G-BLUP and NIRS BLUP models, which utilized relationship matrices based on SNP and NIRS data, respectively, and a third model that uses both matrices as independent terms. The genomic relationship matrices were evaluated when the number of SNPs used to built the matrix varied from 500 to 200,000 SNPs. The objective of this test was to evaluate if PS can complement GS applications under low marker densities. In a second approach, we utilized the NIRS BLUP model to select doubled haploid (DH) lines for germination before planting. Our findings reveal that while G-BLUP models generally outperformed NIRS BLUP models, the model combining both information (PS+GS) yielded the highest accuracy. The increase of the combined model relative to GS alone was particularly higher when low marker densities were used. This indicates NIRS's potential to maintain/improve accuracy together with SNP-based information while reducing marker density, which could decrease genotyping cost in the breeding program. Additionally, results showed that the NIRS BLUP model alone effectively distinguished between high and low germination rates in DH lines, with an accuracy of 0.71. In conclusion, PS is a promising low-cost tool that could help to optimize the sweet corn breeding program.

## Abstract

A severe infestation of Striga hermonthica dramatically reduces maize yield in Africa. Resistance to Striga is an essential trait in a new maize cultivar developed for release. The development of predictive markers is a prerequisite to expedite the genetic improvement of maize. Expression analysis based on RNAseq was performed to study the transcriptome profile of susceptible (5057) and tolerant (ZD05) maize genotypes grown in rhizotron, with and without infestation. Root tissues were collected in three replications at 3, 9, and 22 days post-infestation (dpi). The transcripts were compared to identify the up-and down-regulated genes for each genotype at each time point using a log2 fold-change of 1.5 as a threshold. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on the current data and literature review, eight DEGs were selected for validation of their expression with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The result of the qPCR experiment was analyzed using the E-method ratio of the Advanced Relative Quantification Experiment with an external reference in the LightCycler 480 software. The relative quantification technique compares the levels of two different target sequences in a single sample. The relative expression of all target genes agrees with the previous transcriptomic results, with an inverse relationship between respective genes’ expression in resistant and susceptible genotypes. The study corroborated that the resistant inbred line supports a significantly lower level of Striga development. Moreover, the resistant (ZD05) genotype up-regulates more genes involved in plant secondary metabolism, defence and cellular transport. The initial results suggest that the downregulation of host genes seems essential for establishing parasitic weed infestation. Expression analysis revealed key genes providing an insight into the mechanism of host-plant resistance. These putative/candidate genes can be utilized in developing robust trait-linked markers for marker-aided selection of Striga-resistant germplasm.

## Abstract

Root system architecture (RSA) crucially affects soil resources utilization, including water absorption. Hence, comprehensive understanding of the genetic and physiological processes underlying RSA development is critical in order to inform breeding programs aimed at improving resilience to abiotic stresses. In this study, we characterized and cloned qRoot-yield-1.06, a major QTL associated to maize RSA traits and yield stability over water regimes. qRoot-yield-1.06 was previously mapped on bin 1.06 in the cross between Lo964 and Lo1016, two inbred lines known to differ in their RSA. The QTL effect was confirmed by developing pairs of near-isogenic lines which solely differed in the allelic constitution of the target QTL. QTL fine mapping and positional cloning were carried out exploiting a large nearly-isogenic recombinant population. Root phenotyping was based on shovelomics combined with software-assisted root images analysis. A list of candidate genes was prioritized and the causative gene, a SOS-like Na+/H+ antiporter, was identified using a combination of approaches including TILLING, qRT-PCR and transcriptomics. We showed that the (+) QTL allele from Lo1016 enhances the root system size by increasing in the number and length of lateral roots, in comparison with the (-) QTL allele from Lo964. Our findings indicated that native allele sequence variation at a SOS-like gene impacts RSA under non-saline conditions, suggesting a role of this gene in root development.

## Abstract

Complex phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation, environmental differences, and genotype-by-environment interactions (G×E). We used field experiments with two levels of the environmental factor soil moisture to identify constitutive and G×E QTL in several mapping populations in maize. To gain a better understanding of gene function and phenotypic effect of these QTL (Woods et al., 2022), we used a functional genetics approach to perturb individual gene models. For each gene model, we searched for loss-of-function mutations within the coding sequence, generated by the insertion of UniformMu transposable elements (McCarty et al., 2005). We created BCF3 lines in order to be able to evaluate root phenotypes of genotypes with alternate homozygous alleles at the target gene models. Measurement of root pulling force (RPF) on plants at silking showed that the mutant line had significantly higher RPF than the wild-type (p < 0.05). The variation in RPF that we observed captured differences in other feature-extracted root traits such as area, depth, and number of root tips. Building on the field-based observations, our hypothesis posits that alternative states at this gene lead to varying signals of nutrient deprivation and supplementation, subsequently influencing distinct patterns of root growth. We aim to characterize and compare gene function, evaluating its impact on root trait variation within mutant and wild-type lines subjected to two levels of factor soil moisture in a growth chamber experiment. Additional functional genetics will be addressed to provide cross-species insights, thereby enhancing our biological knowledge of the genetic architecture that regulates complex root traits.

## Abstract

Southern leaf blight (SLB), caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, is a major foliar disease of maize worldwide. Identifying genetic variations contributing to resistance against SLB is crucial for maize yield and quality. Here, we used an association mapping panel consisting of 270 diverse inbred lines with high-density genetic markers to dissect the genetic basis of SLB resistance. Overall, fifteen significant variants corresponding to ten candidate genes were identified as associated with SLB resistance. We found thirteen of the fifteen associated SNPs co-localized with previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Two annotated genes located in the SLB-resistant QTLs were shown to be involved in plant defense pathways. Through insertional mutagenesis and transgenic validation, we demonstrated that ZmMAPKKK45, which encodes a mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) associated with the MAPK cascade, is positively regulating SLB resistance. Overexpression of another candidate gene ZmLSP, which encodes a leaf senescence-related protein could significantly enhance the resistance of maize to SLB. Our results provide resistant loci/genes as direct targets for crop resistance genetic improvement.

## Abstract

Indigenous maize (Zea mays) varieties from the Oaxaca region of Mexico have been shown to support nitrogen-fixing bacteria in mucilage produced by their aerial roots. Maize plants with this trait can obtain 29-82% of their nitrogen from this symbiosis in the right environmental conditions. A better understanding of the genetic factors that contribute to this trait will enable greater use of biological nitrogen fixation to support the global demand for cereals and reduce dependence on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Here we assess population structure among eight populations of doubled haploids generated from inbred PHZ51 and three landrace parents. A two-location field trial of two doubled haploid populations shows heritability is generally low for the number of nodes with aerial roots, the number of roots per node, and the root diameter. However, noticeable differences are observed between populations that are consistent across locations. Furthermore, we identify QTL associated with aerial root traits unique to each population and shared between populations. While additional research is needed to confirm and expand these results, our findings support pursuing the development and adoption of maize varieties with this trait to improve global food insecurity and reduce environmental degradation attributed to synthetic fertilizer use.

## Abstract

The introduction of exotic germplasm in a breeding program is a pre-requisite to broaden the genetic basis of germplasm breeding. Recurrent selection is an important breeding scheme for populations adaptation. The main proposal of our work was to evaluate the genetic potential of the 16 tropical, mixed, and temperate germplasm populations across tropical environments. The 16 populations were composed of tropical, temperate, and mixed maize populations structured in half sibs and progenies S1 evaluated across two locations at Minas Gerais, Brazil. A mixed model approach was used to estimate variance components, and genetic gains of the 20 progenies for recombining were predicted based on grain yield (GY) per se and multiple traits FAI-BLUP (Factor Analysis and Genotype-ideotype Design) index. Selection was done to reduce flowering time (days to silking - DTS) and increase GY. Also, selection was performed based on each local and across locals. Our results showed that there was large genotypic variation for all trials. Variance components due to progenies were highly significant (P0.10) for all trials. The estimates of broad-sense heritability were high and ranged from 0.64 (UFVM200(HS)C3) to 0.87 (BS17). Although genetic predicted gains were high for per se GY selection, the index selection provided more efficient predicted gains for architecture and flowering traits. Therefore, we decided to use the index selection. For populations BR106, BRSSM, BS16, BS26, BS27, BS28, BS29, FS8A(S), FS8B(S) and UFVM100(HS)C2, selection for each environment was more successful, while for BR105(S)C1, BS17, BSTL, IPR164 and UFVM200(HS)C3, selection based on average of locals were better. We concluded that there is genetic variability within the populations, so it is possible to select, and that selection based on index were the best strategy.

## Abstract

A nested factorial mapping population of 1,959 doubled-haploid inbreds across twelve bi-parental populations was used to characterize yield and agronomic performance in the non-Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern. Six parental lines of this population are expired Plant Variety Protection inbreds, which have an important role in the core germplasm of modern proprietary germplasm. The last parent is a public line derived from material released by the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize project. Two hybrid sets were generated using unrelated Stiff Stalk testers as males, PHT69 and FBLL. This study aims to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in elite germplasm under selection for complementary effects and their implications for traits of interest. A genetic analysis was conducted using a multi-parent QTL structure on a multi-environment yield trial grown in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We found a weak correlation between female inbred performance in the two testers, indicating a nonadditive effect for grain yield. Significant QTLs that were specific to testers, across testers, and the difference between testers for various complex traits, such as anthesis and silking, grain moisture, test weight, and grain yield, were identified. Parental allelic effects from the twelve female populations were tester-specific, highlighting the importance of complementarity in hybrid performance.

## Abstract

Canopy architecture plays a key role in determining photosynthetic productivity, efficiency, and ultimately biomass and grain yield. Canopy architecture is, in turn, determined by combination of agronomic decisions, plant spacing and layout, and plant phenotypes, including leaf number, leaf angle, leaf length, and leaf width. While a number of studies has focused on identifying genes involved determining leaf number – often the result of changes in flowering time – and changes in leaf angle, the determinants of variation in leaf length and leaf width have been comparatively less investigated. Here we developed and employed a pipeline to conduct resampling based GWAS with BLINK and used it to identify genomic intervals linked to variation in leaf length and leaf width in a dataset collected from the Wisconsin Diversity panel over two field seasons. Taking advantage of a new and higher density genetic marker dataset derived from whole genome resequencing, we identified a total of 9 loci significantly associated with leaf length and an additional 9 loci associated with leaf width. None of them overlapped. We evaluated the repeatability and consistency of these loci using data from the SAM association panel collected from a third environment. Ten of the 18 originally identified loci showed significant effects on the same loci in this replication study. Change in allele frequency for the loci identified in this study among maize populations from different continents suggest some of these loci altering maize leaf morphology may have been targets of direct or indirect selection during the adaption of maize to different parts of the globe.

## Abstract

The maize husk provides a suitable environment to protect the early stage of ear growth and development. Reducing the husk leaf number (HLN) properly is one of the main goals in maize breeding to develop new varieties suitable for mechanical harvesting. HLN is a complex quantitative trait which genetic basis remains unclear so far. We investigated HLN on more than 400 maize inbred lines and constructed segregation populations. The HLN QTL genes was mapped and further fine mapped by using recombinant-derived progeny strategy. Two major QTLs qHLN1 and qHLN6 were finally narrowed down and located on chromosome 1 and 6, respectively. qHLN1 was located in the 58Kb physical region, in which only one gene encoding a transcription factor was named ZmHLN1. Through qRT-PCR analysis of NIL-qHLN1BS351 and NIL-qHLN1US043, and EMS mutant with early termination of ZmHLN1 led to more husk leaf number compared with wild type. ZmHLN1 was identified as the target gene controlling husk number. qHLN6 is mapped to 1.2-Kb region in the promoter of ZmHLN6, which also encodes a transcription factor. qHLN6US043 decreased 2~3 husk leaves relative to qHLN6BS351. Two independent mutant lines consistently increase ~10 more husk leaves. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that ZmHLN6 was highly expressed in NIL-qHLN6US043 relative to NIL-qHLN6BS351. Thus, the 1.2-Kb region in the promoter of ZmHLN6 should contain functional motifs in HLN. Furthermore, the yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H) and the split firefly luciferase complementation assay in tobacco leaf epidermal cells have been conducted. Both assays showed that ZmHLN1 and ZmHLN6 physically interact in vitro and in vivo. Introgression of qHLN1US043 and qHLN6US043 into modern maize inbreds and hybrids significantly decreased HLN without affecting yield. The analyses of natural variations and domestication characteristics for two genes will be performed to develop new molecular markers for molecular breeding in Maize.

## Abstract

Goss's bacterial wilt and leaf blight, caused by the Gram-positive actinobacterium Clavibacter nebraskensis (Cn), is a significant bacterial disease of maize and affects the maize production in the US and Canada. Similar to many plant pathogens, genetic resistance remains one of the best control strategies. However, host responses to Gram-positive bacteria and the molecular and genetic resistance mechanisms associated with developing plant disease symptoms caused by Cn in maize are poorly understood. We analyzed gene expression upon Cn infection in both resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines, identifying Cn-triggering expression of genes involved in multiple hormone pathways. The mutants of some of those genes are being collected from the public stock center or generated through CRISPR editing for genetic analysis. At the same time, mapping of the resistance gene has identified multiple genomic regions conferring Goss’s wilt resistance. We have constructed mapping populations for further finer-scale mapping. In this poster, we will update our mapping result through using Bulk Segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq). Our integrated approach aims to provide foundational data for mechanistic studies to mitigate the effects of this important maize disease.

## Abstract

Leaf angle is a strategic component of plant architecture, and an important area of plant research that interconnects fundamental research on the mechanisms of boundary formation during plant development and agriculture production through improved crop canopy for increased productivity. Due to lack of reliable, automated strategies for measurement in high-throughput, leaf angle has been typically measured on a single leaf per plant in large-scale genetic studies. Several mutations affecting maize leaf angle were cloned and characterized, and genetic and transcriptomic analyses identified additional candidate genes implicated in ligule-auricle development. There remains a huge gap between known developmental genes and their contributions to the natural, phenotypic variation observed in diverse maize accessions. Our analysis has demonstrated that diverse maize inbreds are extremely polymorphic for this “within-plant, leaf angle variation” phenotype. Our overall project goal is to enrich the fundamental understanding of the genetic control of leaf angle variation across the canopy in maize and to provide mechanistic insights into genetic manipulation of plant architecture for continued crop improvement. We are working on four connected aims in this project. Aim 1: Genome-wide identification of genes underlying leaf angle variation across the canopy. This is facilitated by high-throughput phenotyping with a PhenoBot system to quantify multiple leaf angles at different nodes. Aim 2: Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of genes underlying leaf angle variation at two contrasting canopy levels. Aim 3: Functional analyses of genes underlying leaf angle variation through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in maize inbreds with different leaf angle types. Aim 4: Develop educational materials for K-12 teachers to create teaching gardens that help incorporate plant biology content into their curriculum. In addition to cross-training of postdocs and students, we will specifically develop and disseminate grade-level text sets and accompanying seeds for the creation of teaching gardens on school grounds.

## Abstract

Genomic selection (GS) emerged as part of the solution to ensure food supply for the growing human population, thanks to advances in genotyping technologies and improved understanding of quantitative genetics and the genotype-phenotype relationship. In essence, GS is a breeding strategy to predict the genetic merits of individual genotypes for selection using their genotypic data and a trained model. It includes three major steps: training population design, model building, and prediction and selection. With GS, the role of phenotyping in breeding has switched from generating data for selection to generating data for model building. The increased capacity of GS to evaluate more genotypes, in combination with shorter breeding cycles, has led to a wider adoption in plant breeding. Many research studies have been conducted to optimize GS with greater emphases on crop- and trait-specific applications, and predictive models. A successful GS strategy, however, encompasses more than just predictive models; it also involves strategic design and planning. The most significant advances in GS include integrating phenomics, turbocharging gene banks, analyzing multitrait and longitudinal traits, and crosslinking crop growth models, environmental covariates, and reaction norms. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), GS can be further improved by either upgrading the entire framework or individual components. AI-driven GS can consider new layers of information including multi-omic, enviromic, and pangenome datasets. As GS complexity increases, so do the challenges associated with storing, handling, and processing large volumes of data, as well as the need for higher expertise across various domains. Technology advances, research innovations, and emerging challenges in agriculture will continue to shape the role of GS in plant breeding.

## Abstract

Maize landraces are a valuable source of genetic diversity for facing climate change due to their local adaptation. High-throughput pool genotyping (HPG) is a cost-effective approach to genotype maize landraces and identify promising sources of alleles for tolerance to abiotic stress. We applied this approach on a large collection of European and American maize landraces to i) characterize its genetic structuration; ii) identify genomic regions involved in adaptation through environmental association studies; iii) perform genomic prediction (GP) of both adaptive and agronomic traits. Landraces were structured according to their history and environmental conditions. GP yielded high accuracy, allowing to identify promising landraces. We identified genomic regions associated with bioclimatic variables that could be putatively involved in adaptation to abiotic stress. Combining eco-genetic and genomic prediction opens an avenue for using these genetic resources for prebreeding.

## Abstract

In a world with a changing climate, the yield stability of crops has become a major concern. To better understand the genetic control of yield stability, crop traits and environmental data were collected from common sets of maize hybrids (including a new set of era hybrids, ex-PVP hybrids, and commercial hybrids) as well as the SAM diversity panel which consists of ~350 inbreds were grown over three years (2021-2023) at six locations from western Nebraska to eastern Iowa that span elevation and annual rainfall gradients. At some locations multiple levels of N fertilizer and/or irrigation were applied. In total, this project assayed crop performance in 47 distinct environments. Hybrids were grown in replicated four-row yield plots, while the inbreds were grown in replicated two-row plots. Multiple types of trait data (e.g., plant and ear height, days to anthesis, a variety of ear traits, stalk nitrate concentration, and transpiration) and environmental data were collected using traditional manual assays, robots, UAVs, satellites, and novel sensors. The resulting data are being analyzed to identify genes associated with plasticity/stability of multiple traits.

## Abstract

Modern breeding programs rely heavily on efficient methods to screen large numbers of diverse genotypes for traits of interest, such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, or improved yield. After identifying the genetic loci or genes that associate with these traits using GWAS or functional analyses, it will then benefit future plant breeding efforts seeking to incorporate these traits into new crop varieties, whether through conventional breeding or gene editing techniques. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based image data has been increasingly used for this task, as it allows entire test plots to be quickly and cost effectively phenotyped. Previously, we have developed methods to improve accuracy of machine learning techniques for automated tassel counting by removing non-tassel pixels, as well as identify vegetation indices correlated with traits like leaf area, nitrogen (N) content, and kernel weight and then use GWAS to identify genes associated with these UAV-extracted traits. In this study, we used both multispectral and visible color (RGB) image data to develop N-responsive vegetation indices (VI). This enables UAV-based imagery to be used as a reliable predictor of N-responsive traits, and can be leveraged to track plant growth stages and health through the season. Eventually, we will incorporate the N-responsive VIs into the genomic selection pipeline to develop N-resilient maize.

## Abstract

Plant-microbiome interactions play important roles in mediating plant responses to ever changing environmental conditions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are key symbionts of many plants and can provide benefits to their host such as enhanced nutrient uptake and drought tolerance. Close AMF-bacterial interactions may also make a historically underappreciated contribution to the symbiosis through mechanisms such as nutrient ion release from the surrounding soil. Understanding this tripartite interaction will allow us to develop strategies for maximizing microbiome benefits to bioenergy crops such as sorghum that are grown with few inputs on marginal land to avoid competition with food crops. Through multi-year field trials across contrasting ecoregions in the United States (GA and AZ), we seek to identify genotypes that can best benefit from AMF associations, and sorghum genetic markers related both to the symbiosis and specific partner choice. Here, we present results from the ongoing analysis of the first year GWAS study in GA where we implemented a factorial N/P fertilization experiment for 337 sorghum genotypes from a bioenergy association panel. Through this, we documented the extent of variation in both aboveground yield phenotypes and the AMF species recruited by individual genotypes across the panel. We also have used this system to explore methods of how to best identify and quantify the composition and abundance of bacterial consortia within plant roots. On a subset of samples from the factorial fertilization treatments, we implemented both amplicon and whole-genome shotgun sequence approaches to develop more accurate quantitation methods of microbial abundances based on host-plant sequence normalization. Through this approach, we reveal patterns in bacterial composition not apparent from traditional analysis alone.

## Abstract

The doubled haploid (DH) approach is a promising alternative to traditional self-pollination for inbred line development, primarily because it decreases the time taken to obtain homozygous lines. Currently, DH technology is widely dependent on chemical treatment (colchicine) to induce haploid genome doubling and, subsequently, male fertility. These chemicals can be harmful to humans and plants and have typically recorded a doubling rate of about 10 to 30% due to the recalcitrance of some temperate genetic materials. Thus, genome doubling remains a bottleneck to large-scale DH production. Although to a limited extent, spontaneous haploid genome doubling (SHGD) and male fertility of maize haploids (without chemical treatment) have been studied and recorded doubling rates ranging from less than 5% to greater than 50%. Recently, there has been increased interest to omit chemical treatment and rely on SHGD as it would eliminate the use of colchicine for genome doubling and make it possible to directly plant a haploid seed in the field and avoid greenhouse costs. A major breakthrough was the discovery of a maize line A427 with SHGD and a major QTL mapped to chromosome 5. The introgression of this major QTL to elite germplasm may overcome the need to use colchicine. However, it is necessary to identify additional sources of major QTL for SHGD in maize as they may (1) simplify managing SHGD in different heterotic groups and (2) allow simplified introgression procedures into elite germplasm by stacking respective SHGD QTL. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) aims to identify additional sources of major QTL controlling SHGD.

## Abstract

Waxy maize is used as industrial raw material, feed, and food. It carries the recessive waxy1 (wx1) gene that elevates amylopectin content to 95-100% compared to 70-75% in normal counterpart. Iodine staining for maize pollen could serve as a straightforward and cost-effective method for waxy genotype. Here, we describe a method for rapid identification of waxy genotypes by RGB values from stained pollen images and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). A set of F2 segregating population were planted to identify genotype of individual plant along with two parental lines and F1 plants serving as known genotype information for LDA modelling. Pollens of wild type (Wx1Wx1) stained into black color, while pollens of waxy type (wx1wx1) remained unstained displaying yellow or brown color. Heterozygous type (Wx1wx1) showed the mixture of stained and non-stained pollens with the ratio of 1:1. Image of stained pollens was captured under a microscope. Individual pollen grains in a captured image from a single plant were determined by setting threshold and the Region of Interest feature in ImageJ software. RGB values from identified pollen grains was extracted and then averaged to obtain a datapoint for the individual plant. Datapoints from two parental lines and F1 plants were used to create a discriminant function in LDA while the function was applied to those from F2 individuals for genotype classification. The LDA results were validated from self-pollinated or test-crossed ears from the F2 individuals. This technique is rapid, accurate and cost effective in identifying waxy genotype in maize and can be easily employed even where marker-assisted breeding is limited.

## Abstract

The flowering time in crops is a critical trait for consistent agricultural performance and developing lines for specific environments. Due to the complex quantitative genetic architecture of flowering time, prediction of diverse lines in new environments is difficult. Much of this complexity arises from the large network of genes and regulatory elements that interact to hasten or slow the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in the developing maize plants. These interactions, detected through either functional genetics studies with knockout mutants or quantitative genetics studies with natural genetic diversity, contain information critical to understanding flowering time differences between different maize lines. Using gene network information in a predictive context will shift prediction methods towards a systems biology approach, where individual alleles cannot be considered separately from the gene network and genetic background. Although including expression data from over 50 genes in a single model, for example a static mixed-effect model or a dynamic gene regulatory network model, may not be feasible, it is important to consider that in individual maize lines, a unique subset of genes within the network may be able to capture a majority of the trait variation and be sufficient for accurate prediction of flowering time. Simplified gene networks, based only on genes segregating in the genetic background of interest, can incorporate gene network information into modeling approaches without requiring extremely complicated, comprehensive models. Incorporating gene network information within prediction models will also increase the interpretability of results by connecting to functional processes at the cellular level. Genes involved in the flowering time network have diverse functions, including light receptors, transcription factors, and enhancer elements, and the significance of each of these categories in the prediction step can give insight into the biological consequences of gene interactions. The tropical inbred lines CML277 and Tzi8 are given as examples of how network information can be used in predicting the flowering time of maize lines significantly different than the standard reference line B73.

## Abstract

Maize is one of the largest produced crops and a heavy nitrogen feeder and although it is more nitrogen efficient, excess nitrogen fertilizer application and production has proven to be correlated to increased greenhouse gas emissions for either mineral or organic fertilizers. This leads to contamination of underground water bodies and accounts for 6% of US greenhouse gas emissions that is 55% of agriculture emissions. This figure is however low in Africa but is expected to increase by 2050 due to increasing populations in the region and the need to increase food production. In contrast, Africa needs to increase nitrogen fertilizer inputs by 4-fold, but building healthier soils with higher carbon and nitrogen balance could be key as there is evidence that certain root nitrogen remobilization mechanisms are present in perennial relatives of maize. This research seeks to achieve the remobilization of at least 40% of the nitrogen contained in the upper biomass (stover) to the roots late season to increase the organic nitrogen pool. We will therefore be involved in identifying the genetics involved in the remobilization process by backcrossing an inbred line B73 with Zea diploperennis and tracking nitrogen seasonally. We will then genotype the introgressions to identify their positions within the genome. Complementing these studies, we intend to graft Zea diploperennis with Zea mays roots. We hypothesize that grafting perennial roots to the annual shoot system for gene identification purposes will speed gene identification. Assessment will be done on their stay-green properties and their gene expression profiles analyzed. We hope that results from this study can be used to model the impact of future nitrogen recycling varieties for African agriculture.

## Abstract

Inbred seed parent production traits, including kernel grade size and the resultant fraction of sellable kernels, impact the commercial feasibility of producing large quantities of hybrid seed. Applying selection for seed production traits during the breeding process enables identification of new inbred lines that will support efficient hybrid seed production. We evaluated a set of 421 inbred lines primarily comprised of materials with Expired Plant Variety Protection (exPVP) for kernel grade size and sellable kernels using manual measurements. The kernels were harvested in 2022 from a replicated experiment grown at the West Madison Agricultural Research Station. The percent sellable kernels ranged from 26.6% percent in LASER (an ornamental ex-PVP) to 100% percent in multiple formerly commercial ex-PVPs, including LH235. Using 12,952 SNPs, a significant association with marker S5_163144081, was identified for the percent of sellable kernels. This marker lies within, Zm00001eb240940 (prh40), an annotated protein phosphatase gene and has an effect of -3.3 (percent sellable kernels). The allele conferring a negative effect for percent sellable kernels is not evenly represented across heterotic groups; Iodent minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.0%, Non-Stiff Stalk MAF = 15.0%, Stiff Stalk MAF = 4.1%, Unrelated/Flint MAF = 23.7%. The negative effect allele occurs at a lower-than-expected frequency in the Stiff Stalk heterotic group (p-value of 0.03) which contains inbreds traditionally used as the seed parent in hybrid seed production while it is more common than expected in the Non-Stiff Stalk heterotic group (p-value of 0.02), traditionally used as the pollen parent. Our results support that useful genetic variation exists for percent sellable kernels and that developing inbreds improved for this trait is a reasonable goal within a breeding program.

## Abstract

Nitrogen inputs are a major driver of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. One solution is to breed crops that are more efficient at using nitrogen while maintaining yield. Modern breeding approaches have been successful at integrating beneficial traits into commercial varieties but domestication and improvement has decreased genetic diversity, resulting in the loss of many potentially beneficial alleles. Recapturing extant diversity still present in maize’s undomesticated progenitor teosinte (Z. mays parviglumis) could aid in further gains in yield and other important agronomic traits. A synthetic maize population was designed to produce lines that have around 12% teosinte alleles, with alleles also from the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population founders and B73. 430 double haploid lines from this population, crossed to a common parent (PHZ51), were grown over two growing seasons in nitrogen limited condition and 270 phenotypes were recorded. Traits included agronomically relevant traits like grain yield, biomass, and nitrogen content. Root architecture traits were measured using 3 different technologies: analysis of 2-dimensional images of excavated root crowns, 3-dimensional x-ray computed tomography scans of excavated root crowns and data gathered from mini-rhizotrons in the field during the growing season. Elemental compositions of seeds for 20 elements were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry pipeline. Lines were sequenced and a genetic map was constructed using the Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) framework. Previously identified QTL were identified using this approach giving evidence for the viability of using the PHG framework in a large association study. Genome wide association scans were performed for each trait and significant associations were identified within each trait category, providing a basis for improvement of the nitrogen efficiency of maize.

## Abstract

Here we sought to identify genes involved in producing variation in maize metabolism and link these genes to non-metabolic trait outcomes. We assayed 26 metabolites using GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) using leaf samples collected from 796 diverse maize inbred lines grown under field conditions during a two-hour period on a single day that roughly moderately proceeded flowering for the majority of lines. Resampling Model Inclusion Probability Genome Wide Association Study (RMIP-GWAS) was conducted for metabolite traits using a set of approximately 26 million SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism). And Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) were conducted using RNA-seq data obtained from paired leaf samples collected from the same leaves at the same time. We focused on six metabolites significantly associated with genetic variants. A total of 51 and 39 candidate genes were identified via RMIP-GWAS and TWAS, respectively. A Random Forest feature importance-based approach identified 10 genes which overlapped with the set of candidates identified via TWAS. Further RMIP-GWAS on 42 non-metabolic traits, including agronomic, hyperspectral and photosynthetic traits, identified 7 loci associated with variation in both metabolic and non-metabolic traits. A number of genes identified are known to play important roles in plant metabolic networks including Zm00001eb254940, Zm00001eb002790, Zm00001eb035010 and Zm00001eb142730, which encode the enzymes shikimate kinase, glutathione S-transferase, lipoxygenase and trans aldolase. These results enable future studies to delve deeper into the roles of these metabolites and genes in plant growth and development processes.

## Abstract

Abstract Slow-activating anion channel 1 (slac1) is a key regulator in stomatal closure, thus impacting water use efficiency (WUE) and productivity. The stomatal response to daily atmospheric parameters shapes the stomatal conductance (gsw) dynamics and determines WUE. A drawback of breeding for WUE by reducing gsw to minimize water loss is that it can decrease productivity. Our objective is to enhance WUE in maize by utilizing slac1 alleles that allow for the differential regulation of stomatal closure, enabling the selection of higher gsw predominantly in the morning when vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is lower, thus improving WUE without compromising productivity. To evaluate the feasibility of generating extreme gsw phenotypes that have optimal diurnal dynamics, we created a series of hybrids by separately crossing a slac1-mu null allele and its non-mutant slac1 counterpart with eight inbred lines showing variation in haplotype diversity at slac1, along with differences in slac1 expression levels. We measured the diurnal dynamics of gsw on the eight hybrid pairs, comprising slac1/slac1 and slac1/slac1-mu genotypes, totaling 16 hybrids, in a replicated field trial over an approximately 11 h period on multiple days during the 2023 field season. By fitting a Gaussian model to the daily measurement of gsw for each hybrid, three parameters were extracted: peak value of gsw, time of maximum gsw, and rate of daily gsw dynamics. On average, we observed that the Gaussian model reasonably captured the data distribution (R2=0.65), and the three parameters demonstrated a moderate level of broad-sense heritability. Among the eight hybrid pairs, two slac1/slac1 hybrids were found to be significantly different (P

## Abstract

Maize hybrids are often more vigorous and higher-yielding than their inbred parents. Plant-microbe interactions have been shown to affect the magnitude of such heterosis. To investigate whether this may be due to differences in defense responses, we examined disease resistance and basal immunity in inbred and hybrid maize. In a field experiment measuring resistance to multiple pathogens, we found that heterosis for disease resistance was inconsistent and dependent on both the disease being assessed and on the parental genotypes, while heterosis for plant height was consistent across genotypes as expected. We then tested basal immunity by inoculating several sets of hybrid and inbred lines with microbial elicitors. Hybrids exhibited negative heterosis for basal immunity, meaning a reduction in response to elicitors compared to parental lines. Activation of basal immunity can be energetically costly and reduce the rate of photosynthesis. Based on our results, we hypothesize that, compared to inbred lines, hybrid maize may be able to better regulate the induced defense response to minimize associated growth penalties while maintaining effective disease resistance levels.

## Abstract

Maize lethal necrosis (MLN), caused by co-infection by maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and one of several potyviruses, is one of the most devastating virus diseases of corn. First identified in Nebraska, USA in the 1970s it has since been discovered in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and South America. Although major potyvirus resistance genes are well characterized in maize, most known MCMV resistance is highly quantitative and confers incomplete resistance. Thus, traditional and molecular breeding tools are desirable to develop varieties with elite MLN resistance. As part of a larger screening effort for MCMV resistance, a genome wide association study was performed using the Maize 282 Association Panel which led to the identification of variants on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 8 that are significantly associated with resistance. Notably, two of these variants co-localized with MCMV resistance quantitative trait loci previously identified in the dent corn inbred N211, further delineating these loci as potential targets for molecular breeding efforts. Five of the most MLN resistant lines discovered as part of our screening efforts were used to develop the maize synthetic population, OhMCMV-1, by recurrent selection for MLN resistance. The mean MLN disease severity was more than halved based on a single selection cycle and approximately 20% of the OhMCMV-1 S1 lines evaluated were completely asymptomatic to infection by MLN. The resources generated from these studies are invaluable for breeders interested in developing corn varieties with improved MLN resistance.

## Abstract

Increased variability in weather patterns is one consequence of climate change that may be addressable through changing agronomic approaches. These changes could include shifting planting zones or planting earlier to avoid excessive heat during flowering. However, these solutions result in an increased likelihood of crops encountering freezing events. To make these approaches viable in maize (Zea mays), it is imperative to improve freezing/chilling tolerance in maize. Tripsacum dactyloides, a close relative of maize that diverged roughly 650 thousand years ago, can be found across the Americas. As a perennial, this species must withstand elongated freezing temperatures when it occurs in northern latitudes. The genetic similarity between Tripsacum and maize may allow for freezing tolerance to be introgressed or genetically engineered into maize. We generated extensive genomic resources including newly generated Pac-Bio Hifi genomes for Tripsacum dactyloides as well as a mapping population constructed from crosses between plants sourced from northern and southern locations. To identify causal freezing tolerance genes, F2 seedlings from an open pollinated Tripsacum F1 population were subjected to -7°C overnight temperatures, and extreme phenotypes were collected as freezing tolerant and freezing susceptible bulks for bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Given the open pollination nature of the mapping population, we first estimated the paternal fraction in each F2 bulk by regressing the F1 genotypes onto F2 bulk allele frequencies using genome-wide SNPs. With the identified parents, we then calculated the frequencies of the contributing F1 gametes in windows, which allowed for accurate site-by-site allele frequency imputation and contrasts between susceptible and tolerant bulks. Preliminary results have shown once paternal contribution is accounted for and sites are imputed genomewide, noise is greatly reduced and candidate loci associated with freezing tolerance can be identified at higher resolution. In conjunction with further expression experiments, these QTL will inform future transgenic tests.

## Abstract

The vascular xylem and nonvascular parenchyma tissues represent distinct habitats within a plant for pathogenic bacteria to colonize. Host plants often utilize different mechanisms to defend themselves against vascular and nonvascular pathogens. Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum (Xvv) is an emerging bacterial pathogen of maize that is threatening yields. It is described as a nonvascular foliar pathogen in maize, but a vascular pathogen in sugarcane. The maize Xvv pathosystem offers a unique opportunity to study how host resistance differs in response to the vascular and nonvascular lifestyles exhibited by a single phytopathogenic bacteria. Here we report the use of differential inoculation techniques, florescence microscopy, RNA-seq and linkage mapping to show that (i) vascular colonization by Xvv in maize is possible in susceptible maize genotypes; (ii) different inoculation techniques can be used to induce vascular or nonvascular colonization; (iii) resistance to vascular and nonvascular Xvv colonization in a recombinant inbred line population is independently controlled; (iv) there are striking differences in expression of genes relating to motility and virulence in Xvv when it is inhabiting the xylem versus the apoplast; and (v) there are significant expression differences for genes relating to plant defense in resistant and susceptible plants within the QTL intervals that we mapped. This research is significant because it is the first report of vascular disease induced by Xvv in maize, contributes to the limited knowledge regarding the genetics of resistance to Xvv in maize, and offers insights into how Xvv adapts to vascular and nonvascular lifestyles.

## Abstract

As global temperatures rise, precautions must be taken to mitigate the adverse effects of drought on water retention rates in crops. The cuticle is a hydrophobic layer that coats all aerial plant tissues. It consists of a matrix of cutin that is coated by and intercalated with very long chain cuticular waxes to form a barrier that limits rates of non-stomatal water loss and protects against other environmental stresses. We recorded the concentrations of forty-seven very long chain cuticular wax metabolites (hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty alcohols) from the silks of 448 inbreds of the Wisconsin Diversity panel, each grown in replicate across three year-by-location environments (Iowa and Minnesota, 2016-2017). Total accumulation varied 17-fold, with hydrocarbon, fatty acid, and fatty alcohol constituents displaying 18-, 23-, and 99-fold variation, respectively. To better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying cuticular wax variation, genome wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted for each trait individually. Further, we conducted multivariate GWAS using multiple wax traits or traits from multiple environments to uncover loci responsible for pleiotropic control of the cuticular wax profile. Combined, GWAS and multivariate GWAS yielded two-hundred unique, high-quality candidates, accounting for a high level of genetic variance across all measured traits; among these candidates are known stress responsive transcription factors and hormone receptors, as well as enzymes involved in wax biosynthesis. These candidate genes could be implemented directly into breeding programs or targeted engineering to ameliorate drought stress in silks, thereby improving pollen reception of the silks.

## Abstract

Genotype by environment interaction (GxE) is a well known source of phenotypic variation, but there is more to be understood about the degree to which GxE impacts gene expression. Maize data were collected by the Genomes to Fields project resulting in a unique 3’ RNA sequencing dataset which includes 576 samples at 5 locations with 27 hybrids. Using the RNA sequencing data, we quantified gene expression and created statistical models to partition genetic variation, environmental variation, and GxE variation for each gene. Models estimate the median of expression variation for genotype, environment, and GxE to be 10.3%, 23.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. We found 289, 1327, and 1 genes where over 50% of variation in expression is explained by genotype, environment, and GxE, respectively. These results show that for most genes, the environment has the greatest impact on gene expression, followed by genotype, then GxE; however, this level of impact on expression changes depending on the gene, where some genes’ expression is mostly explained by GxE or genotype. We are continuing to evaluate the statistical power and suitability of this dataset for testing hypotheses related to GxE and will use our findings to inform the design of future experiments.

## Abstract

Atmospheric temperatures are increasing, and extreme precipitation patterns lead to periods of severe drought. Both increased temperatures and drier growing conditions result in a higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The VPD condition is calculated as the difference between the current level of moisture in the air and the potential saturation point. As VPD increases, the atmospheric water demand results in increased plant water loss through transpiration. Past studies have identified VPD breakpoints in maize which are observed when the linear transpirational response to increasing VPD changes in slope. We have observed transpirational breakpoints in Zea mays inbred and hybrid lines. However, in a slac1-mu stomatal mutant, which is unable to close its stomata, we did not observe a breakpoint. This result identified stomatal dynamics as the primary driver of VPD breakpoints in Z. mays. Variation in when and if a VPD breakpoint occurs has been observed in Z. mays, although the genetic mechanisms controlling VPD breakpoints are still unknown. Current methods of measuring transpirational breakpoints are time-consuming, limiting the number of genotypes that can be measured and our ability to identify regulatory genes. We have developed a new high-throughput screening protocol for measuring VPD breakpoints across a diversity of Z. mays lines. Currently, 28 Z. mays lines, including the NAM founders, have been screened for VPD breakpoints. We have found variation in the occurrence of VPD breakpoints and the severity of VPD that is required to provoke a stomatal response. Here we present our findings from our new breakpoint protocol and identify our next steps. Improving our ability to measure VPD breakpoints and identify genetic mechanisms regulating VPD response will provide new insights into stomatal dynamics and the optimization of water use efficiency in Z. mays.

## Abstract

Computational and data-driven approaches to accelerate and optimize breeding programs are becoming a common practice among plant breeders. Simulations allow breeders to evaluate hypotheses and changes in a breeding scheme time- and cost-efficiently, but accurately simulating traits that match empirical data remains a challenge. Here, we address this problem by incorporating information about the genetic architecture (i.e., numbers of causative variants, effect sizes, and modes of gene action) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common maize agronomic traits into simulations. Using at least 200 top GWAS hits as causative variants resulted in a high correlation of 0.54 between simulated and empirical trait data. In addition, reducing the original marker effect sizes estimated by GWAS models resulted in a more realistic partitioning of phenotypic variances from genotype, environment, and their interaction. Our results suggest that incorporating information from GWAS beyond statistical significance thresholds is valuable for simulating more realistic digital breeding phenotypes. To assess the utility of the simulated phenotypic data for digital breeding we are currently comparing the results of genomic prediction and machine learning models trained using the simulated data to the output of models trained on empirical data.

## Abstract

Genomic prediction has played a critical role in transitioning breeding programs to data-driven predictive and prescriptive breeding methods. Modern breeding programs routinely use genomic prediction with SNP genotypic data based on a single reference genome. Recently, teams in multiple cropping systems have demonstrated that pangenome haplotype databases can use low-pass skim sequencing data to impute genome-wide haplotype sequences for new individuals. Imputed haplotypes provide a more complete representation of the genome and more allelic diversity than do SNP genotypes, and we hypothesized that this improved representation of the genome would translate to increased genomic prediction accuracies. In this project we demonstrate that haplotype-based GBLUP models outperform equivalent SNP models in a large-scale North American commercial breeding program, with 3-5% improvement in prediction accuracy for yield. Preliminary results suggest that 60-70% of the gain in prediction accuracy is a direct result of denser genome coverage, with the remaining 30-40% gain coming from increased allelic diversity across loci. Haplotype-based genomic prediction provides an exciting addition to the breeder’s toolbox that translates to improved genomic prediction models and increased genetic gain at scale.

## Abstract

This study explores the potential of triple cross hybrids for organic seed production. Most commercial maize varieties are single cross hybrids. It is difficult to produce seed on single cross hybrids in certified organic fields because seed is produced on inbred parent lines that are small and easily overcome by the weeds that are often present in organic fields. However, triple cross varieties may be good alternatives, particularly from a seed production perspective. Unlike single cross hybrids, triple cross hybrids have three parents and seed is produced on a hybrid parent plant, rather than an inbred. With three parents, selection of parents for a triple cross hybrid is a challenge, especially with regard to heterotic groups. It is not clear how best to take advantage of existing heterotic groups to maximize performance. Moreover, the intricate interplay of genetic material from two distinct crosses in triple cross hybrids leads to a more complex genetic landscape compared to single crosses. Assessing genetic distances among parent lines may be useful for understanding the intricate relationship between parental lines and the resulting hybrid performance. To conduct a detailed genetic analysis, we genotyped a set of parent lines with 8K SNPs. The performance of a set of triple cross hybrids made with these parents was evaluated in multilocation field trials. Examination of the relationship of genetic distance between the parents and hybrid performance may lead to a deeper understanding of the complex genetic dynamics shaping the performance and adaptability of triple cross hybrids.

## Abstract

Comprehensive maps of functional variation at transcription factor (TF) binding sites (cis-elements) are crucial for elucidating how genotype shapes phenotype. Here we present the construction of a first-generation pan-cistrome of the maize leaf under well-watered and drought conditions. We quantified haplotype-specific TF footprints across a pan-genome of 25 maize hybrids and mapped over two-hundred thousand genetic variants (termed binding-QTL) linked to cis-element occupancy. Three lines of evidence support the functional significance of binding-QTL: i) they coincide with numerous known causative loci that regulate traits, including novel alleles of Vegetative to generative transition1, Trehalase1, and the MITE transposon near ZmNAC111 under drought; ii) their footprint bias is also mirrored between inbred parents and by ChIP-seq; iii) partitioning genetic variation across genomic regions demonstrates that binding-QTL capture the majority of heritable trait variation across ~70% of 143 phenotypes in about 0.01% of the maize genome. Our study provides a promising approach to make previously hidden cis-variation more accessible for genetic studies and multi-target engineering of complex traits.

## Abstract

As sustainability concerns regarding nitrogen fertilizer use, aquifer depletion, and the frequency of extreme droughts and precipitation events rise due to climate change, an improved understanding of phenotypic plasticity in crops has the potential to play an important role in improving crop resilience in the face of increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather and reduced access to agricultural inputs like nitrogen fertilizer and water for irrigation. Developing a better understanding of plasticity requires data from the same varieties in more environments than most individual research programs are able to generate. One notable long-running multi-environment field trial is the Genomes to Fields project, however; this project records only a small number of phenotypes, and incorporates only a small number of consistently represented hybrids across all locations. To generate an improved understanding of the role different component traits play in determining overall plasticity for grain yield, we generated data from a panel of 84 maize hybrids grown in replicated trials in 22 environments spanning a 700-mile range in the heart of the U.S. Corn Belt from the Iowa/Illinois border to western Nebraska. Environment played a large role in explaining variation in nearly all of the 23 phenotypes studied, but the relative contributions of genetics and nitrogen management varied among phenotypes, as did the contributions of genotype by nitrogen management and genotype by environment interactions. While individual maize hybrids varied in their average performance and degree of plasticity, no consistent major tradeoff between plasticity and good performance was observed in this study, which contrasts classical studies of phenotypic plasticity in a barley diversity panel studied by Finlay and Wilkinson. This may be explained by the high degree of selective breeding and improvement already applied to the elite public and private sector inbreds employed to generate the maize hybrids employed in this study.

## Abstract

Genetics, environmental factors, and their interaction shape the phenotype of living organisms. Flowering time is a critical trait of adaptation and domestication, exhibiting a diverse outcome of the gene-environment interplay. Understanding the underlying determinants of phenotypic plasticity, the property of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to distinct environmental conditions, is a challenging topic in biology, evolution, and breeding. Herein, with eight B73-teosinte introgression populations evaluated for flowering time in 10 natural field conditions, the primary phenotypic plasticity pattern of flowering time was revealed. We found that diurnal temperature range from 9 to 29 days after planting during the growing season was the critical environmental index. Genetic loci, harboring domestication genes, including ZCN8, ZmCCT9, and ZmCCT10, were identified for reaction-norm parameters (intercept and slope) across environments and flowering time within individual environments through multi-allele QTL mapping. We observed the dynamic genetic effects of these loci along the environmental gradient and different parent-specific allele effects at individual loci. By exploring the genomic relationship and the environmental index, accurate prediction for flowering time was obtained with joint genomic regression analysis. The identification of genomic loci, environmental determinants, and their interplay enriches our understanding of genotype-by-environment interaction and how maize adapted to diverse climates.

## Abstract

One of the goals of the multidisciplinary, multi-institutional project called CERCA (Circular Economy that Reimagines Corn Agriculture) is to create maize cultivars that can be planted several months earlier than the current practice, adapted to the cool spring temperatures that are predicted by climate change modelers to prevail in the US Midwestern Cornbelt of the future. A wide variety of strategies could allow earlier planting and field emergence, including uniform germination under colder temperatures, winter dormant seeds, or deep planting to maintain the meristem below ground until spring. As part of the trait discovery team focusing on the seed germination life stage, we plan to evaluate diverse maize germplasm and related wild species under a range of cold soil conditions. To create the appropriate selection environment, we are using the soil-based LabField™ simulation table, an instrument that has been used to study seed germination behavior in a wide variety of crop species. We present here the results of our preliminary trials, in which we are experimenting with a range of parameters, most importantly soil temperature range, but also planting depth, trial duration, and planting density, by monitoring seed and seedling trait responses.

## Abstract

Carbon partitioning is a key regulator of maize senescence. In some genotypes the inhibition of seed set and subsequent buildup of carbohydrates in source tissue contributes to the phenomenon of non-pollination senescence. Alternative sink tissues can play a pivotal role in accepting excess photosynthate and delaying plant death. A preliminary screen of known non-pollination senescence sensitive and insensitive genotypes showed a strong correlation between cob density and staygreen traits, suggesting relevance of this structure as an alternative sink. Previous attempts to assess the importance of a cob-specific role have been confounded by non-pollination itself, which impedes cob developmental processes. To accurately test the sink strength of the cob, fully pollinated ears on isogenic lines with normal and high cob density are needed for comparison. Pipecorn is a specialty maize variety grown for its large, woody cobs to produce corn cob pipes. Pipecorn inbreds were used as high cob density donor parents and crossed to non-pollination senescence sensitive and insensitive recurrent parent lines B73 and PHG35. Among F2 and BC1S1 populations, response to selection across backcrossing generations for both cob density and diameter traits has been notable. High density selection populations demonstrated transgressive segregation, suggesting synergistic genetic control of this trait compared to the recurrent parents. Pipecorn has undergone minimal genetic improvement, with all publicly available inbreds originating from the original pipe corn open-pollinated variety. New inbred lines are currently being derived from this open pollinated variety to develop pipecorn germplasm for future breeding applications and enhance its performance under modern agronomic conditions.

## Abstract

Sorghum, unlike maize, is primarily self pollinated, creating fewer opportunities for recombination between dissimilar haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium decays far slower in sorghum than in its close relative maize. As a result, genome wide association studies conducted in sorghum typically identify larger genomic intervals with greater numbers of candidate genes. Here we evaluate the use of transcriptome-wide association studies to identify candidate genes in sorghum, a method which has shown promise in soybean, another high linkage disequilibrium crop. Tissue samples were collected from 748 genotypes of SbDiv panel in a two hour interval during a field experiment conducted in 2021. RNA was extracted and RNA-Seq was used to estimate the expression levels of ~27,000 sorghum genes. TWAS conducted using measurements of flowering time and plant height for the same population identified 7 and 3 genes respectively. These included genes with known roles in the traits of interest in sorghum and others linked to the traits of interest based on data from homologs in maize, rice or arabidopsis. These initial results suggest TWAS can indeed provide accurate single gene resolution results in sorghum. Future work will integrate these results with GWAS, eQTL analysis and co-expression networks generated utilizing the same population as well as investigating changes in regulatory networks between maize and sorghum using a paired maize transcriptome dataset. p { color: #000000; line-height: 115%; text-align: left; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0.1in; direction: ltr; background: transparent }p.western { font-family: "Calibri", serif; font-size: 11pt; so-language: en-IN }p.cjk { font-family: "Calibri"; font-size: 11pt; so-language: en-US }p.ctl { font-family: ; font-size: 11pt; so-language: ar-SA }

## Abstract

The genetic enhancement of corn yield is a centra/l aim in modern agriculture, crucial for advancing global food security and sustainable farming techniques. In this study, we utilized a dataset comprising of 750 corn genotypes from the Wisconsin Diversity Panel, collected over the years 2020 and 2021, to dissect the complex genetic determinants of yield. Being a composite trait, yield is determined by various factors including the number of plants per acre, ears per plant, kernels per row, and the weight of 100 kernels. We are calculating the Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) for these yield components to get the reliable phenotypic values for each analyzed trait. We are adjusting complex spatial variability present in field trials by considering genotype, environment, and genotype x environment interaction. (G, E, G x E). A resampling-based Genome-Wide Association Study (RMIP-GWAS) will be applied to identify genetic variants linked to the yield components using 1.6 million SNP markers. By examining the capacity of genetic markers to enhance yield prediction, we will hope for candidate genes expected to significantly influence yield variability. For potentially identified candidate genes mutants will be ordered and backcrossed to introduce these mutations into diverse genotypes. These new genotypes will be characterized to validate the effects of the identified genes on yield. Our research will aim to improve the prediction accuracy and breeding potential of yield for diverse populations in nearby future.

## Abstract

Flowering time, which is fundamental to local adaptation and crop productivity, is controlled by integrated networks of external and endogenous signals. This includes modules for sensing photoperiod and temperature. The spread of maize from its tropical origins to latitudes of the north temperate zone has shifted the control of flowering time toward temperature regulation and away from photoperiod sensitivity. Considering that rising temperatures will hasten flowering times in temperate maize, we hypothesize that reintroducing partial photoperiod-sensitivity can facilitate adaption to climate change. To better understand and model this reintroduction, the ecophysiological basis of flowering time and its genetic control must be elucidated. We test whether a field network constituting a photoperiod gradient can be used to define the physiological reaction norm for flowering time (PRN-FT) in maize, which decomposes autonomous and environment-dependent components of flowering time regulation in a genotype-specific manner. Our results show how selection restructures flowering time plasticity and has shaped the phenotypic space for flowering time in maize. Additional work is ongoing to: (i) characterize the PRFN-FT in near-isogenic lines with introgressions spanning photoperiod sensitive loci (tiling path of haplotypes from tropical lines introgressed into temperate genetic backgrounds), thereby testing the impact of reintroduced photoperiod alleles; (ii) use crop modeling to broadly evaluate the potential for using photoperiod sensitivity to counteract negative effects of warming on flowering time adaptation. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding of the environmental and genetic controls of flowering time in maize, and helps evaluating the merits of reintroducing photoperiod-sensitivity in temperate-adapted maize varieties.

## Abstract

Crop growth and its interaction with microorganisms change yearly, mainly depending on local weather, making the agriculture particularly exposed to climate change. In the last seasons in Italy the climate was characterized by high temperatures that increased the parasitic ability of the fungus Aspergillus flavus and its power to colonize maize kernels, resulting in an increase in aflatoxins level. These molecules have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins; hence, the maximal concentration in agricultural food and feed products and their commodities is regulated worldwide. An important way to contrast the fungus and high concentration of aflatoxins in maize kernel includes planting maize varieties that are resistant to A. flavus. In this study we suggest a simple methodology to test the susceptibility to A. flavus on candidate maize varieties before their release on the market.A panel of 100 breeding varieties of our reference collection was analyzed. Disease phenotypes were scored on artificially inoculated kernels using rolled towel assay. We confirmed the correlation between fungal infection with the reduced development of the seedling and recorded a rather wide variability in the response to fungal invasion between the genotypes analyzed, outlining four classes of susceptibility. The effect of the inoculation of A. flavus on genotypes marketed in different years (2001 vs 2010) suggests an increase of resistance in the latter year due to a success of plant breeding programs. We also investigated the combining ability effects on susceptibility to A. flavus to identify potential parents for hybrid development. The data collected with the laboratory screening will be used to perform a genome wide association study to unravel possible new genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction.

## Abstract

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in cultivated soils, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of major crop species. Studies in controlled conditions have demonstrated the potential of the symbiosis to enhance the growth of host plants. It is difficult, however, to estimate the actual benefit in the field, not least because of the lack of suitable AMF-free controls. Here, we report the use of maize genetic mutants to generate AMF incompatible sentinel plants that can be used as a baseline against which to evaluate the impact of the symbiosis. To estimate the overall (main) effect of AMF and characterize the impact of host genotype on symbiotic outcome, we have selectively incorporated AMF-incompatibility into genetic mapping populations. We are using these populations for trait mapping, estimating AMF, host genotype and host genotype x AMF effects by comparison of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal families. We present evidence of a plant genetic trade-off between performance with and without AMF, indicating the importance of tailoring crop varieties to the AMF “environment”, in the context of different types of agroecosystem. The approaches we present are applicable to other crop species, permit further mechanistic study and are scalable to larger yield trials.

## Abstract

The success of a maize breeding program is very associated with the knowledge of genetic diversity (GD) of parental lines. To access GD, new tools such as artificial neural network can provide better results than usual statical methods. Self-organizing maps (SOMs), an unsupervised neural network, can improve the visualization of clustering onto a two-dimension grid. Thus, our objective was to employ SOMs to access the GD in a panel of 182 tropical maize inbred lines evaluated under different N inputs. Over three Brazilian summer seasons, the panel lines was evaluated under two N inputs: high N (HN) with 200 kg ha-1, and low N (LN) with 20 kg ha-1. The lines were laid out in a 13 x 14 alpha lattice incomplete design with three replications. We evaluated 14 traits, including those related to plant architecture and grain yield. To estimate the variance components, mixed model approach considering pedigree information, was employed. Then, the best linear unbiased predictors were used to construct the SOMs. The combined analysis and SOMs were performed across seasons under each N inputs. Notably, we observed reductions up to 30% in mass of thousand grain, grain yield per plant and grain yield under LN. Variance components were statistically significant (P

## Abstract

Maize production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is threatened by low soil nitrogen (low-N). The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for low-N tolerance related traits is critical to increase the breeding efficiency through the integration of marker-assisted selection (MAS). In this study gene targeting markers (GTM) via SeqSNPs was used to determine the population structure and identify candidate genes for low-N tolerance. A total of 150 extra-early yellow, orange and white quality protein maize (QPM) inbred lines were evaluated under low-N and high-nitrogen (high-N). The inbred lines were genotyped using 2,500 SeqSNP markers which targeted genes previously reported for grain yield and other low-N tolerance related traits. Population structure analysis and phylogenetic tree both classified the genotypes into six sub-populations. Two, one, two and 10 significant SNPs were identified for low nitrogen base index (LNBI), low nitrogen tolerance index (LNTI), grain yield under low-N and grain yield under high-N respectively. The two SNPs for LNTI co-localized the putative gene hotspot GRMZM2G077863, belonging to the GDSL esterase/ lipase gene family and highly expressed in the roots of young seedlings at 6 days after planting and during tassel meiosis prior to flowering, which suggested a strong association of the gene with the traits. The putative genes GRMZM2G026137 and GRMZM2G004459 on chromosome (chr) 1, GRMZM2G111809 on chr 2, GRMZM2G380319 on chr 3, GRMZM2G442057 and GRMZM2G080314 on chr 6, GRMZM2G011213 and GRMZM2G090928 on chr 8, and GRMZM2G338056 and GRMZM2G150598 on chr 9 are involved in normal plant growth, tassel meiosis, root architecture, plant cell proliferation, cell growth, reproduction and post-embryonic development. The validation of these markers and the candidate genes in other population could make them useful for MAS to increase the selection efficiency and genetic gain in breeding for low-N tolerance.

## Abstract

The genetic mechanism underlying heterosis has been studied for over 100 years, resulting in several possible genetic models. The complementation model has the most empirical support, stating the masking of recessive, deleterious alleles underlies heterosis. This implies more distantly related populations that are distinguished by more genetic variants will produce hybrids with higher heterosis. An extreme pattern of differential gene expression called single parent expression (SPE) supports this hypothesis. SPE occurs when the hybrid and one parent express a gene while the other parent does not, leading to a greater number of genes expressed in the hybrid than either parent. Previous work has identified the patterns and genetic mechanisms of SPE in temperate maize, but wider crosses (e.g., between temperate and tropical lines) have not been studied. The phenotypic consequences of SPE have also recieved little attention. Here, we developed a full diallel population from thirteen diverse inbred maize lines, including temperate and tropical germplasm, to address these questions. In 2020, fourteen traits related to plant architecture, yield, and growth rate were measured in Ames, IA, with most traits showing extreme heterosis. Greater heterosis was observed with more distantly related crosses and was not constrained to crosses between historically important heterotic groups. RNA-sequence data generated for each genotype in the half-diallel identified SPE. Across genotypes, the number of SPE genes ranged from 28 to 374, with significantly more paternal expressed SPE occurring and most SPE private to one or two genotypes. While the amount of SPE did not correlate to genetic distance of the parents (Pearson's correlation = 0.058), crosses between the same heterotic groups may share more SPE. The results of this study will strengthen the claim of SPE gene expression as an extreme example of the complementation model of heterosis.

## Abstract

Stomata serve an essential role in regulating the exchange of CO2 and water between leaves and the atmosphere. Stomatal conductance is determined by the combination of stomatal density (SD), stomatal size and stomatal aperture. Stomatal density is a function of a hierarchy of developmental processes acting along both the medial (i.e. midvein to margin) and longitudinal (i.e. ligule to leaf tip) axes of the leaf. In maize, proof-of-concept has been established for quantifying stomatal patterning as a kernel density distribution (KDD) that describes the self-repeating pattern of stomata on the epidermis. In doing so, it provides a means to break up a composite, complex trait such as SD into its subcomponents. This study aims to test the same approach in sorghum to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) that can identify candidate genes underlying variation in stomatal patterning of a model C4 species. Optical tomography and AI-enabled computer vision were used to score stomatal positioning across 842 diverse accessions of photoperiod-sensitive, biomass sorghum. KDDs were generated for each genotype allowing for extraction of informative parameter-traits. Initial trait correlations provide evidence that there are some common trait-trait correlations shared between maize and sorghum particularly for cell size and shape while sorghum still shows some unique patterning attributes of its own such as wider distances between stomatal files compared to maize. On-going GWAS/TWAS analysis will identify potential gene targets for engineering altered stomatal patterning and water use efficiency in sorghum. In summary, this project provides evidence that the KDD method can be generalized across grass species allowing for both comparisons of overall morphology, and in the future could be used to explore the degree to which genetic drivers are shared between different grass model systems.

## Abstract

Genomic data is a useful to predict trait values in the large breeding population before field trial, but the decision-making for select favorable individuals is challenging because the breeders often consider multiple traits. Personal experiences and field knowledge are valuable abilities for crop breeding. Thus, advancing “prediction to selection” remains to be important but unresolved. We propose an integrative multi-trait breeding strategy that incorporates trait predictions at the whole plant level to make a cohesive decision for selecting superior candidates via a machine learning algorithm, called Target-Oriented Prioritization (TOP). We found that the likelihood of identifying the valuable one from 300 breeding candidates was 0.3% for an untrained person, also as an impossible mission without breeding experiences. However, we will have the possibility of 60.8% for identification of the valuable one if empowered by TOP algorithm. It provided a potential breeding-decision tool for further moving forward to genomic breeding.

## Abstract

The maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the important food crops and extensively studied for the crop genetics and breeding. In the Korean peninsula, it was introduced since the middle of the 16th century. Over 3,000 Korean maize landraces have been collected and deposited in the National Agrobiodiversity Center, South Korea. Most of the Korean maize accessions have been maintained as local landraces, implying preservation of diverse morphological traits with a wide range of variation. However, there has been a few studies for discovering the phenotypic characteristics of the Korean maize germplasm. To develop representative Korean maize landrace panel, we collected published phenotype data of 2,690 accessions. Total 12 categorical and 17 quantitative traits were evaluated to assess morphological diversity among collected accessions. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the variations of Korean maize germplasms were largely explained by traits including flowering time, kernel yield, and stalk diameter. In particular, the waxy and flint types showed distinct distributions by both stalk diameter and tillering patterns. We selected total 276 accessions as a core collection by Core Hunter 3 algorithm. Furthermore, we investigated not only the morphological traits in the field but also kernel phenotypes by observing dissected seeds with microscopy from the subset of the core collection. As a result, many novel germplasms with multiple aleurone layers were found, indicating that Korean landraces have maintained the original genetic variation that has been removed during the modern breeding program.

## Abstract

Heterosis, a pivotal genetic phenomenon, has been successfully harnessed in agricultural practices to enhance crop production yields. Despite extensive molecular investigations into the basis of heterosis, understanding its transcriptomic contributions has remained elusive. In this study, we present an integrative analysis encompassing seedling traits, adult agronomic traits, and molecular traits (transcriptomic data) derived from 200 maize inbreeds and their 600 F1 hybrids. Our findings reveal that the majority of hybrids (85.3%) exhibit a greater number of active genes compared to their inbred parents. We identify 7.8% of genes display positive mid-parent heterosis (MPH) for expression, while 7.9% show negative MPH. Notably, genes with both extremely low and high expression levels exhibit low heterosis, while intermediate-expressing genes demonstrate higher heterosis. Strong correlations between gene expression variation and expression MPH suggest that divergent selection on essential genes is more likely to result in heterosis. Heritability analysis indicates that heterosis traits, particularly for gene expression, are more heritable than traits per se. Results from expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis highlight that the heterosis of molecular traits is predominantly regulated by trans-eQTL, with most MPH eQTLs exhibiting a complete–incomplete dominance pattern. Furthermore, we identify 452 eQTL hotspots governing the MPH of gene expression. Interestingly, target genes of three transcription factors under these eQTL hotspots are significantly enriched at ChIP-seq or DAP-seq peaks. In conclusion, our study underscores the significant contribution of trans-eQTL to gene expression heterosis, providing insights into the genetic basis of heterosis for agronomic traits at the gene expression level.

## Abstract

【Objective】The formation of mature phenotype is related closely to the whole growth and development of organism, so investigating traits from the level of whole growth and development could improve the understanding of dynamic genetic basis of phenotype and expand more genetic resources from the time dimension.【Method】We monitored the whole growth status of the maize CUBIC panel using the high-throughput phenotyping platform.【Result】Over 1,002,240 RGB images were obtained, and 67 image-based traits (i-traits) from 18 time points were collected. We found the i-traits exhibited four diverse temporal patterns responsive to plant growth. The majority of the QTLs affecting i-traits are time-specific (84%), which largely explained the considerable portions of missing heritability of i-traits in the late growth phase. We simulated the accurate ontogenetic trajectories of maize genotypes, the diversity and genetic architecture of which were systematically understood. We found two genes that functioned differentially upon the plant growth, which greatly influenced the fine tuning of vegetative-reproductive transition in maize.【Conclusion】Our results provided the insights into the important traits from the ontogenetic perspectives, which proposed a new route for maize genome breeding via growth complementation.

## Abstract

Technological developments have enabled larger-scale experiments capable of measuring multiple phenotypes throughout ontogeny in more diverse germplasm that has been grown in many environments. Although these data present many interesting statistical and computational problems due to their volume and diversity, quantitative genetic analysis of such datasets typically relies on the same fundamental framework: the one-locus model as used in, for example, QTL mapping. In this model, the genetic effects at a locus are estimated from the genotypic values. However, phenotypes develop over time (ontogeny), are influenced by the environment (plasticity), and result from inter-locus interactions (epistasis), among others. Each of these factors—singly or in combination—defines a different context for the estimation of genetic effects. While all of these factors interact in the expression of a phenotype, they are often studied in isolation to answer specific questions in biological sub-disciplines, using quantitative genetic analysis as a convenient analytical tool. Here, we use graphical and mathematical models to demonstrate parallels between the estimation of genetic effects in these different contexts and propose a unified framework to integrate discoveries from different disciplines and enable cross-disciplinary, combinatorial exploration of genetic effects in multiple contexts. Systematizing context-dependent genetic effects will help us better understand the landscape of genetic variation across diverse contexts by linking the results of gene cloning and molecular studies with statistical studies of phenotypic variation. This can be applied to improve the precision of selection decisions in plant breeding programs, inform complex trait dissection, and study the dynamics of phenotypic evolution in changing environments.

## Abstract

les-2014 is a recessive lesion mimic mutant that produces symptoms mimicking the grey leaf spot disease of maize. This mutant appeared in an EMS mutagenized population of Mo17, following a new mutagenesis approach that involves multiple rounds of mutagenesis over successive generations. We have named this approach NextGEM2 (for next-generation mutagenesis version 2). les-2014 was backcrossed to Mo17 over multiple generations, and an F2 population generated from cross of the mutant with B73 allowed the mutant to be mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4. Whole genome sequencing-based cloning was next used to identify the mutant gene underlying les-2014. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the lower end of the long arm in chromosome 4 were filtered based on their allele frequency and nonsynonymous effects to determine one SNV unique to les-2014. The mutation was found to cause a missense mutation that changed the amino acid Ala to Pro at position 223 of the enzyme hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) that competes with the JA pathway enzyme allene oxide synthase to divert the oxylipin pathway towards green leaf volatiles (GLVs). That the correct gene was cloned was verified by showing that corresponding allele of a second les-2014 mutant also sustained structural changes in the hpl1 gene. Further characterization of the mutant and the hpl1 gene is being done in collaboration with Mike Kolomiets of Texas A&M university. We are especially interested in knowing why a block in the production of GLVs ends up killing corn leaf cells.

## Abstract

Natural resilience to heat and drought has made Sorghum bicolor one of the most important cereal crops in the world. One of sorghum's unique abilities its unique ability to suppress the growth of tillers in response to abiotic stress. Grassy tillers 1 (gt1) is one of the key genetic factors implicated in sorghum tillering. This research characterized the stages of tiller bud development and examined the role gt1 plays in the gene response networks for drought stress. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to analyze the expression of gt1 in wild-type sorghum plants under drought and non-drought conditions. This data was paired with measurements of tiller bud length taken at set intervals after planting. Analysis of these measurements suggest that tillering plasticity in sorghum is impacted by water stress in the early stages of development but may only be visible in certain tissues due to the natural suppression of older tiller buds during normal development. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed to assess the relation between gt1 and other known sorghum genes in response to water stress. CRISPR was utilized to create a gt1 knockout mutant line and a wild-type sibling line of sorghum plants. Tissue was collected once plants were visibly drought stressed. RNA-seq analysis revealed that, under water stress, several genes were upregulated along with gt1 in the wild-type sibling but not the gt1 mutant, suggesting they are part of a drought response network that involves gt1. This research shows that early tiller bud development is sensitive to drought and that response appears to be moderated by a gene network containing gt1. Understanding how drought affects tillering in sorghum is essential for optimizing the management of this crop in a rapidly changing climate.

## Abstract

We present topological data analysis (TDA) – methods for studying the shape of data in multivariate space – as an alternative to the long-standing statistical framework for studying crop diversity. This is demonstrated with multi-scale data combined from phenotyping platforms and field experiments on traits for crop growth and development. Using TDA to study genetic and phenotypic spaces in maize, we find that directed interrogation of topological structure provides unique insights into evolution and adaptation. At the phenotypic scale, TDA uncovers physiological divergence among genotypes with common flowering times, in addition to different evolutionary and breeding trajectories for phenotypic change. At the genetic scale, TDA also reveals how common flowering times arise from genetic heterogeneity of polygenic variation. For genetics and breeding, TDA helps to localize territories of multivariate space with taxa (populations, genotypes, or alleles) that are favorable for genetic dissection and environmental adaptation. By developing a biologically interpretable understanding of topological information, we define a new approach for generating testable hypotheses and actionable results for crop improvement.

## Abstract

Phenotypic plasticity is the property of a genotype to produce different phenotypes under different environmental conditions. Understanding the genetic and environmental factors behind phenotypic plasticity can help answer some longstanding biology questions and improve phenotype prediction. Through a set of focused studies of multiple traits in multiple crops (maize, sorghum, rice, wheat, and oat), we have recently developed an integrated framework for gene discovery underlying phenotypic plasticity and performance prediction across environments. With the identified environmental index to quantitatively connect environments, a systematic genome-wide performance prediction framework was established through either genotype-specific reaction norm parameters or genome-wide marker-effect continua. These parallel genome-wide approaches were demonstrated for in-season and on-target performance prediction by simultaneously exploiting genomics, environment profiling, and performance information. At the same time, the varied effects of genes, QTLs, and GWAS peaks along the environmental index visualized the environmental context of genetic effects, i.e., the gene-environment interplay. With additional multi-stage measurements of plant height, we profiled the genetic effect continua both along the environmental gradient and along the developmental stage. A conceptual model with three-dimensional reaction norms was proposed to showcase the interconnecting components underlying the phenotype: genotype, environment, and development, and at the three levels: single locus, multi-locus haplotype, and individual organism. This general framework and the companion CERIS-JGRA analytical package should facilitate biologically informed dissection of complex traits, enhanced performance prediction in breeding for future climates, and coordinated efforts to enrich our understanding of mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation. We propose that further integration of development and physiology at the whole-plant level and gene expression network at the molecular level would enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation observed under diverse environments.

## Abstract

Genomic selection is one of the ways maize breeding has sought to keep pace with global demand for agricultural goods. Conventional genomic selection strategies are regression-based and were originally designed to make predictions using moderate-to-small sets of genomic data. However, the data landscape has changed in the time since conventional methods were designed and the scale of genomic and phenomic data collection has dramatically increased over recent decades. Alternatives to conventional genomic prediction strategies will be required to better utilize big data and to close margins for prediction accuracy improvement that still exist in numerous traits and species. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven models are poised to be the next evolution of genomic selection because of their suitability for big data and wide success at prediction in fields like natural language and medicine. However, many of the AI models developed for genomic selection have not yet consistently exceeded the performance of convention methods. But, AI models are rapidly evolving, and the current state-of-the-art AI model is the transformer which has not been extensively investigated for genomic selection. Transformers are a type of AI model that differs from others because of its use of attention and positional encoding. Attention evaluates which values in the input sequence are important for contextualizing a given input value. Positional encoding provides the order/positions of input values separately from the input values allowing for parallelization of sequential data. BERT (bidirectional encoding representations from transformers) is a type of transformer model that is suitable for this type of prediction task. Because of these capabilities, a BERT-based model pre-trained using Genomes to Fields (G2F) initiative maize data is being designed and investigated for genomic selection. Adapting existing AI methods to leverage domain knowledge in genetics and breeding may bridge the gap between AI and genomic selection.

## Abstract

The domestication and improvement of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) has focused on above-ground traits for crop improvement, neglecting below-ground phenes as selection criteria. Interactions between root architecture and nutrient capture affect plant growth and yield. The root system architecture influences the volume of soil exploration by the plant, whereas fine root traits affect water and nutrient uptake that ultimately influence yield. For the most part, root architectural traits have been overlooked in breeding programs because of challenges associated with phenotypic characterization and the lack of standardized screening methods. This study evaluated agronomic, and root architectural responses of maize hybrids grown with different levels of nitrogen inputs and under the manipulated weed competition in organically managed fields. The experiment applied an RCBD using a split-split plot arrangement, with three external nitrogen fertility inputs as whole plots (0, 112, and 224 kg/ha), ten hybrids as subplots, and two weed treatments (weed-minus, weed-plus) as sub-subplots. The study was conducted over three years (2018 to 2020) in four organically managed locations, with four replications per location. Hybrids were phenotyped for above-ground traits and assessed for below-ground root architectural traits using high-throughput image analysis. Significant variation was observed for above and below-ground traits across all treatment combinations. Higher nitrogen availability positively influenced above-ground traits (grain yield, plant height, ear height, and stem diameter). Increased nitrogen levels reduced root system complexity and increased root angles. Hybrids with simple roots and wider root angles obtained higher grain yield than hybrids with complex and narrow root angles. Hybrid performance varied significantly under weed competition. The study highlights the importance of considering below-ground phenotypes for crop improvement in maize and provides insights into the influence of nitrogen availability and weed competition on maize production in organically managed fields.

## Abstract

Maize plant architecture is an often under-appreciated collection of traits that has been critical for its explosive yield improvements over the past century. Much of this improvement can be connected to simply planting more individuals within a given space, increasing from ~30,000 plants/acre to over 80,000 plants/acre with today’s modern corn hybrids. The push for genotypes that can withstand tighter, more competitive growing space has resulted in the selection of hybrids with a more upright architecture. A maize plant with a so-called “ideal plant architecture” will have prone leaves near the bottom to efficiently absorb light while being less shaded by more upright leaves near the top. Since leaves and tassel branches are both lateral organs, some of the genes that control leaf architecture also play a pleiotropic role in the development of tassels. The interplay between these morphological traits, however, is not well understood. Based on our group’s previously collected data on leaf angle and tassel branch number, we selected 426 accessions from the Ames population to maximize genetic as well as architectural diversity in these two traits. We planted this subset of lines in two fields at each of 2 locations (MO and IL) and used a combination of remote and proximal phenotyping platforms and sensors to collect data on whole plant morphology and physiology. Handheld phenotyping tools were used to measure spectral reflectance and absorbance as well as photosynthetic efficiency of leaves to correlate them with architectural traits. Additionally, UAVs, ground rovers and an imaging backpack was used to collect RGB images, multispectral and hyperspectral reflectance and LIDAR data. Algorithms are being developed to reconstruct plant architecture from the various images and point clouds and novel trait extraction for genome-wide association analyses. This will facilitate rapid phenotyping of traits of interest, e.g. leaf angle and tassel architecture, as well as more elusive traits that can’t easily be measured such as how the architecture of individuals combine to form a canopy.

## Abstract

Modeling genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E) remains a challenging yet indispensable aspect of genomic prediction and breeding. Incorporating G×E into genomic prediction models significantly enhances prediction accuracy and guides breeding endeavors towards developing varieties with enhanced adaptability, stability, and performance across diverse environmental conditions, fostering sustainable and resilient agriculture. Within the Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative, the Maize GxE Project has meticulously evaluated over 180,000 field plots encompassing more than 4,500 maize hybrid varieties across 200+ environments in North America. Leveraging genotypic, environmental, and G×E information from this project, our study aimed to predict hybrid maize performance in different environments across the United States. In this pursuit, we introduced the Weighted Records Prediction (WRP) method for genomic prediction. WRP integrates weighted training records into the prediction model based on the precision of Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) and the similarity between the training and testing sets. Employing both linear mixed models and machine learning techniques, we assessed the prediction accuracy of this novel method. Our preliminary results showed WRP might improve the prediction accuracy for hybrid maize grain yield.

## Abstract

The Mutator (Mu) transposable element is a highly active DNA transposon that is native to Maize. Recently, targeted sequencing techniques have been utilized to identify the precise insertion locations of inherited Mu elements. This technique, known as Museq, has been used to quickly identify genetic knockouts. To better understand the de novo activity of Mu, we developed a modification to Museq, known as Museq2, to improve the quantifiability and sensitivity for detecting de novo insertions. Quantitative improvements in Museq2 were facilitated by the incorporation of molecular counting and suppression PCR to reduce the amount of non-transposon amplification. Museq2 has a detection threshold of 1 Mu insertion in 100,000 wild-type copies of DNA, allowing for precise analysis of de novo insertions over 5 orders of magnitude. We applied Museq2 to matched leaf, root, endosperm, and pollen tissue from individual plants and detected on average 80,000 de novo insertions per sample. Inherited and de novo insertions were distinguished by filtering insertions that were shared between pre-zygotically derived endosperm tissue and the zygotically derived tissue. De novo Mu insertions most frequently occurred in hotspots of ~1 kb, with thousands of specific hotspots identifiable across the Maize genome. We compared Mu insertion preferences across tissue types to evaluate the tissue specificity of Mu activity. Surprisingly, many hotspots were shared between tissue types. This finding may suggest that some of the biological determinants dictating Mu insertion preference may lack tissue specificity. Additionally, we find that Mu inserts into a palindromic target sequence motif just outside of Mu’s target site duplication. Overall, these findings provide the first insights into the tissue-specific analysis of de novo insertions for any transposon and demonstrate that the sensitivity of Museq2 can be used to gain a great deal of insight into the well-studied Mutator transposon.

## Abstract

Early maize lines were domesticated from Teosinte parviglumis, with subsequent introgressions from Teosinte mexicana. Domestication traits in modern maize include increased kernel row number, loss of the hard fruit case and dissociation from the cob upon maturity, as well as fewer tillers. Molecular approaches have identified several transcription factors involved in the development of these traits. However, these studies have also shown that a more complex regulatory network is responsible for these strong morphological differences than originally hypothesized, and our understanding of the tissue-specific regulation as well as of its variability across inbred lines is still lacking.In this study, we investigate the transcriptional regulation that resulted from the domestication process, focusing on conservation and variability across multiple tissues and inbred lines. We generated histone-modification and transcription factor ChIP-seq in parallel with transcriptomics datasets in up to 5 different tissues of 3 inbred lines which span the phenotypic diversity of maize inbreds, as well as the teosinte inbred TIL11. We then developed an automatized computational pipeline to integrate these datasets as well as publicly available data, and which could also be applied to any organism.We identified regulatory regions in each tissue of each inbred, including those responsible for the tissue-specific expression of developmental genes. This integrative analysis refines the functional annotation of the genome, notably by identifying distal enhancers with bi-directionnally expressed enhancer RNAs, reminiscent of “super enhancers” in animal genomes. We show that, even though pollen grains are the most differentiated tissue on a transcriptomic level, and especially with respect to the regulation of transposable elements, ears show the least conservation both in gene expression and within regulatory regions, reflecting conspicuous morphological and physiological differences between maize and teosinte.The identification of the molecular signatures of the domestication process improves our understanding of transcriptional regulation in maize and can provide a framework for directed breeding strategies in plants.

## Abstract

Maternal de-repression of R1 (Mdr1), a DNA glycosylase active in the central cell and in early endosperm development, removes methylation through a base excision repair pathway leading to asymmetric methylation of the maternal and paternal genomes. This asymmetric methylation has been hypothesized to lead to genomic imprinting of alleles, a phenomenon in which an allele is expressed in a parent of origin dependent manner . Previous research identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between mutant mdr1 and wild-type W22 endosperm, finding a weak relationship between Mdr1 DMRs and imprinting. While we can obtain single mutants of both Mdr1 and its paralog, Dng102, a double mutant is lethal indicating an essential function in gametophytes. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of wild type (WT) and mdr1 mutant endosperm 15 days after pollination to find 186 differentially expressed (DE) genes and TEs, of which 134 had a nearby or overlapping DMR. Helitrons are enriched among DE TEs as well as among TEs overlapping DE genes. Many (58%) of these features were previously identified as maternally expressed (MEGs) in a prior study of imprinting with an additional 19% (77.8% total) demonstrating maternally biased expression in WT endosperm, highlighting the role of Mdr1 in imprinted expression. However, of 240 previously identified MEGs, only 44% are DE in this dataset. We therefore aimed to understand the features distinguishing DE and non-DE MEGs. DE MEGs are enriched for endosperm-specific expression and DMR overlap. Interestingly, none of the MEGs with conserved imprinting in Arabidopsis were DE, so although Mdr1 alone can establish imprinting for many genes, there appears to be redundancy in imprinting control for critical genes. This research marks an advancement on the understanding of not only Mdr1's role in imprinted expression, but also the general relationships between demethylation and gene expression in the endosperm.

## Abstract

While the mechanism by which Helitrons pick up host sequences is yet unknown, it is crucial to find out if Helitrons are capable of ensnaring fully functional genes and relocating them throughout the genome. Because lack typical transposon structural traits like target site duplications and terminal inverted repeats, they are difficult to detect computationally. We created an online search tool for identifying Helitron elements ( http://bo.csam.montclair.edu/helitronscanner/). DNA sequences in FASTA format can be uploaded or copied by users. To make sure users feel comfortable with the well-designed GUI, four back-end functions have been developed. On the website, each function is in the upper right corner. For users who want to upload a file and receive a fast response from the server, the Quick-Run tool was developed. If necessary, the user can also specify the file's name, including the type of extension. For the purpose of data mining Helitrons in the genome of their interest, biologists will find this online tool to be extremely useful. For the time being, the 5' and 3' ends of Helitron elements are identified using the long short term memory (LSTM) concept. Our initial findings showed that training was successful on the training dataset and that performance improved on the test dataset.

## Abstract

Long terminal repeats (LTR) retrotransposons, found across eukaryotes, are transposable elements which can copy and insert themselves into other loci within a genome. These transposable elements are similar to retroviruses in that they rely on reverse transcriptase to “copy and paste” themselves elsewhere in the host genome. From their own RNA transcript, they are able to use reverse transcriptase to make another DNA copy of themselves. This initially gave them the moniker, selfish genes. However, in the decades after the discovery of reverse transcriptase and LTR retrotransposons, it became known that non-genic DNA could have other functions. LTR retrotransposons are sources of mutation, inserting themselves into and mutating genes within their host organism. However, LTR retrotransposons are prone to mutation themselves, quickly becoming inactive, incapable of transposition. LTR retrotransposons constitute approximately 75% of the total genomic sequence of maize. The vast majority of these LTR retrotransposons are completely inactive. While these inactive retrotransposons can be useful for gleaning information about an organism’s evolutionary history, the rare active LTR retrotransposons are of more interest. They are capable of causing mutations in current maize crosses and maize inbred lines. In this study, we created a tool for filtering out the inactive LTR retrotransposons and locating potentially active ones by adding extra functionalities to the freely available tool “LtrDetector” for locating LTRs. In an initial filter, LtrDetector found over three million potential LTR retrotransposons across thirty publicly available maize lines. After incorporating restrictions for size, an intact primer binding site, a polypurine tract, and coding sequences for reverse transcriptase, RNase and integrase, we narrowed down that large pool of candidates to just 27 potentially active LTR retrotransposons.

## Abstract

Plants alternate between multicellular haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations. The sporophyte-to-gametophyte transition (SGT) is a transition from sporophytic to gametophytic expression that occurs during gametophyte development. The SGT is defined by global changes in steady state transcript levels and involves various changes in genome regulation. In maize pollen, widespread gametophyte genome activation occurs between late unicellular microspore and bicellular microspore stages, setting the timing of the SGT around pollen mitosis I (Nelms & Walbot, 2022). The SGT sets the stage for active transcription of the haploid pollen genome, causing pollen to express phenotypes and undergo haploid selection. We are using single-cell genomics to explore two facets of the SGT that determine the timing and scope of haploid selection: timing and regulation. While we know the SGT occurs around pollen mitosis I in maize, we do not know if this timing is conserved in other species. To address this, we are determining the timing of the SGT in Arabidopsis, tobacco, and poplar. Alongside this, we are also studying genes that regulate the SGT in maize. Mdr1 and dng102 are DNA glycosylases that act redundantly during the SGT to activate a set of 58 pollen-specific genes, which account for >10% of the pollen transcriptome. Double mutants for mdr1 and dng102 cannot be transmitted through pollen, demonstrating that these two genes constitute a necessary component of genome regulation during the SGT. This research will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in the current understanding of the haploid generation of plants, especially regarding the timing and scope of haploid selection, which is relevant to breeding practices and agriculture.

## Abstract

Maize knobs are heterochromatic domains distinguished by significant variations in their quantity, size, and distribution along chromosomes. At the DNA sequence level, these knobs are composed of tandem arrays featuring two distinct repeat types: K180 and TR-1. While the existence of specific knobs has been associated with adaptive traits, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for these correlations remain elusive. Notwithstanding this understanding, the epigenetic state of knob regions still lacks comprehensive elucidation. To illuminate the dynamics of chromatin structure in K180 and TR-1 knob regions, we utilized chromatin accessibility data from four distinct tissues (ear shoot, endosperm, coleoptilar node, and root tip) of Zea mays B73v5. The preliminary examination of chromatin structure patterns entailed visual inspection utilizing differential nuclease sensitivity mapping data within a genome browser (genomaize.org). The findings revealed that TR-1 knobs consistently maintained a closed chromatin structure pattern. Conversely, K180 knobs exhibited tissue-specific variations, with the endosperm displaying the most closed chromatin, followed by the coleoptile node and ear shoot. Unexpectedly, the root tip demonstrated the highest levels of chromatin accessibility. To delve into the significance of this variation, a quantitative analysis employing a z-score-based approach was conducted. DNS-Seq data for each tissue were utilized for peak calling, and the positively identified peaks were subsequently overlapped with the two types of knob repeats. Z-scores, representing the deviations in standard units from the mean expected intersections, were computed. The results concurred with the qualitative analysis, depicting TR-1 with consistent heterochromatic patterns across tissues, while revealing notable variation in K180 knobs. Remarkably, the root tip exhibited an unexpected behavior, featuring a z-score nearly four times higher than expected for a heterochromatic region (-9.5). This implies that the chromatin of K180 knobs might undergo remodeling during maize development, challenging the conventional notion of static packing.

## Abstract

Hybrid incompatibilities triggered by wide crosses can limit plant breeders’ ability to utilize broad allelic diversity present in wild relatives of crop species. An unusual type of hybrid incompatibility has been characterized between maize and its wild relative the Mexican teosinte - a “hybrid decay” in which the fitness of backcrosses progressively declined despite becoming practically isogenic to maize. Initial analyses suggest that this sickly phenotype may be caused by improper regulation of transposable elements (TEs) in hybrids. Here, we further explore both the phenotype and the genetic determinants underlying hybrid decay in backcross populations. We have confirmed the transmission of hybrid decay into two distinct genetic backgrounds, B73 and Mo17, and its persistence in 5 generations of backcrossing to the healthy parental line. Backcrossed individuals show reduced values for several traits, and there is a slight increase in severity of hybrid decay if it is transmitted maternally rather than paternally. We performed long-read whole genome sequencing using Nanopore on a single BC11 individual descending from the initial cross between W22 and the teosinte sourced from Valle de Bravo, Mexico that produces the hybrid decay phenotype. We are now characterizing structural variation between the BC11 line that exhibits hybrid decay and the W22 reference genome to determine the extent of unregulated TE variation in the genome.

## Abstract

When a chromosome has two centromeres a process known as the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle (BFB) generates reciprocal duplications and deletions in mitosis. BFB was first studied by Barbara McClintock and led to the discovery of transposable elements. The genomic effects of BFB are poorly understood due to the uncontrollable nature of the phenomenon. The development of an inducible centromere system addresses this issue by enabling BFB to be started and stopped. A transgene fusing the centromeric histone variant CENH3 to a DNA binding domain induces centromere formation over a large array of DNA binding motifs. This system will be used to induce BFB for a generation then generate progeny no longer undergoing BFB for genomic studies. This system has been successfully tested in preliminary work that yielded two transmissible BFB haplotypes. Transposon activity will be assessed prior to and following BFB to provide insight into the scale and locality of transposon activity. Changes in transposon activity have been linked to changes in epigenetic state which leads to the hypothesis that BFB is altering epigenetic regulation which activates TEs. Nucleotide and histone modifications will be surveyed prior to and following BFB to test this hypothesis. This research will revisit McClintock’s original observations at the molecular level, aiming to understand the structural and epigenetic changes that lead to transposon activation.

## Abstract

Meiotic recombination is a crucial process during which homologous chromosomes exchange genetic materials, impacting evolution and breeding. We investigated the influence of DNA methylation on meiotic recombination in maize mop1 (mediator of paramutation1) mutants, which affect CHH (H = A, T, or C) methylation near transcriptionally active genes. We resequenced 97 and 110 backcrossed (BC1) individuals derived from female mop1 mutants and female wild-types, and 122 and 94 BC1s derived from male mop1 mutants and male wild-types, identifying crossovers (COs) at high resolution. Using a Hidden Markov Model, we identified 4,048 COs, with approximately 50% occurring within a 2kb interval in all populations. The mop1 mutants display an increased frequency of COs at the distal ends of the chromosomes. Importantly, this effect is more pronounced during female meiosis as opposed to male meiosis. This observation indicates that the mop1 mutation exerts a differential influence on the distribution of COs along chromosomes, with the impact varying based on the sex. Interestingly, the shift in the CO landscape in both sexes correlated with an enrichment of miniature inverted repeat DNA transposable elements. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that CO sites identified in mop1 mutants had lower methylation levels than the same regions in WT, suggesting that mop1 introduces new CO sites and alters the CO landscape by locally reducing CHH methylation. Furthermore, the study reveals that CO hotspots are more widespread in the mop1 mutants, providing additional insights into the broader impact of the mop1 mutation on the genomic distribution of CO. Moreover, our data showed that mop1 mutants tend to introduce new crossover sites in the genomic regions with higher genetic diversity, the mechanism of which remains unclear. These findings shed light on the role of DNA methylation in meiotic recombination in maize at both local and global scales.

## Abstract

DNA demethylation by DNA glycosylases is essential for endosperm development. Demethylation of the maternal but not paternal genome results in genomic imprinting at genes where demethylation is required for transcriptional activation. In maize, two closely related DNA glycosylases, MDR1 (a.k.a. DNG101) and DNG102, redundantly perform this function, but MDR1 has a stronger effect. The majority of their target loci appear to be demethylated but not transcriptionally activated. To determine how transcriptional activation is related to chromatin structure, we used CUT&Tag in wild-type and mdr1 mutant endosperm with antibodies for two histone modifications, H3K56ac for active chromatin, and H3K27me3 for repressive chromatin. While many MDR1 target loci are associated with H3K56ac, more commonly they are associated with H3K27me3. Many of these loci have H3K27me3 specifically in endosperm, where they are demethylated. These results suggest that the removal of one form of transcriptional repression from the maternal genome (DNA methylation) is replaced by another (H3K27me3) to maintain repression, albeit by a different mechanism. We are currently searching for genetic features that could explain which loci gain H3K27me3 when they are demethylated by MDR1 and which loci gain H3K56ac. We also hope through this work to learn why some loci but not others are demethylated in endosperm, and how that demethylation affects chromatin structure and transcription. Understanding interactions between DNA demethylation and histone modifications will provide insights into the genes and processes that control endosperm development.

## Abstract

RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved mechanism that regulates gene expression at the transcriptional (TGS) and post-transcriptional levels (PTGS), with the outcomes of these silencing pathways differing profoundly in their persistence. Generally, PTGS represents a shorter-term silencing program while TGS, due to amplification of small RNAs (sRNA) from target loci, forms a feedback loop between sRNA and heterochromatin that is heritable through the germline. The silencing outcome of RNAi crucially relies on the interaction of sRNAs with Argonaute proteins (AGO), forming AGO-effector complexes that target homologous RNAs. While novel RNAi functions have evolved many times across eukaryotes, plants appear to have the most functionally diverse repertoire of RNAi machinery. The diversity of sRNA biogenesis factors coincides with an expansion of AGO genes, blurring the lines of how plants control the functional outcome of a given silencing sRNA. While seminal work in Arabidopsis has identified properties of sRNAs associated with AGO loading, the expanded AGO gene families in plants with large, repeat rich genomes like maize and rice highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the complex sorting mechanisms of plant AGOs. To address this need, we characterized maize AGO transposon insertion mutants and generated catalytic AGO mutants by targeting AGO PIWI domains with CRISPR-Cas9. We crossed these mutants into the b1 paramutation system to investigate the role of maize AGOs in epigenetic inheritance. We found that maize AGO2 is involved in suppressing spontaneous silencing of b1 and that loss of AGO2A affects the transmission of silencing through the male germline, leading to normal segregation of light and dark plants when crossed to B-I. These results suggest that AGO2A is involved in the establishment of b1 paramutation and that AGO2A and/or AGO2B are involved in balancing TGS and PTGS, perhaps through competition with RdDM-clade AGOs for substrate sRNAs.

## Abstract

In maize, transposable element (TE) rich regions of the genome control most of the genetic variation for phenotypes. TEs are highly polymorphic and differ between individuals in presence-absence, sequence diversity, genomic location, and activity level. Investigating patterns of TE abundance and diversity have the potential to illuminate early maize domestication history, which has been difficult to research using SNPs or genic regions of the genome. In particular, specifics of where maize was domesticated are still unknown due to confounding population structure and continual gene flow between populations. Population-specific TEs can refine our understanding of the geography of domestication beyond the regional scale through identification of shared and unique TEs in maize and teosinte. Identification of teosinte population(s) with unique TEs present in all maize populations has the potential to indicate which populations of teosinte maize was domesticated from and in which geographical regions early maize domestication occurred. To test this hypothesis, we compared TE composition of 195 maize and teosinte individuals across 5 populations using short reads analyzed with RepeatExplorer2, an unsupervised clustering algorithm. We then compared overlap and divergence of TE clusters between populations of teosinte and maize while controlling for the age of the TE insertion and underlying population structure. Comparison of different TE clusters allows for detection of candidate geographic regions for early maize domestication. Updating our understanding of maize domestication can inform current research on maize diversity and evolution.

## Abstract

Transposable element insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) are transposable element (TE) sequences not found in the same location between individuals. TIPs have been shown to contribute to dramatic differences in phenotype which has compelling implications for crop improvement and genome evolution. Historically, a major challenge with characterizing TIPs on a genome-wide level is access to high quality genome assemblies, precise annotation of reference transposable elements, and algorithms that can accurately use this information with short-read data. Now, with access to genome assemblies from 700+ plant species, and multiple assemblies within some species, we are poised to study polymorphic TE insertions at the genome and population levels. There are several tools available that use short-read resequencing data from the population together with reference TE annotations to identify novel TIPs. Here, we benchmark six programs using Arabidopsis and maize resequencing data, with regards to precision, sensitivity, F1, FDR, and power of discovery relative to a gold standard set of TIP calls from whole genome alignment of reference quality genome assemblies. One substantial drawback to these six programs is each program's runtime and memory efficiency within large complex genomes. Consequently, we developed a fast and memory efficient new tool, SWIF-TE (Short-read Whole-genome Insertion Finder for Transposable Elements), which is built to balance computational resources and accuracy for practical use in species with large genomes. We further characterize how SWIF-TE provides variable accuracy based on mappability of the region, genomic context (e.g. genic vs non-genic regions, centromeric regions, etc.), and TE classification. This benchmarking study provides valuable insight into the computational tools that are best suited for the identification of TIPs based on the biological questions of interest and the data and information that is available for the analysis.

## Abstract

The endosperm of maize (Zea mays L.) kernel is comprised of multiple specialized cell layers playing important roles in nutrient transport and storage. Here we characterized the gain and loss-of-function mutants of the maize unstable factor for orange1 (Zmufo1) that had cell differentiation defects and elevated accumulation of reactive oxygen species, oxidative DNA damage, and cell death phenotypes in the basal endosperm regions of the developing kernels. Antioxidant supplementation during in vitro culture of developing kernels alleviated the excess ROS, reduced DNA damage, and restored cell morphology in the basal endosperm. The transcription of endosperm development, redox homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and chromatin remodeling-related genes were affected in Zmufo1 mutants. Overexpression of Zmufo1 also altered histone methylation marks in the enhancer and gene body regions of pericarp color1 (Zmp1), the classical marker gene that led to the discovery of the ZmUfo1-1 gain-of-function spontaneous allele by Charles Burnham in 1960. Zmufo1 encodes a nuclear protein with very low similarity with known proteins that interact with diverse partners, including chromatin remodelers and transcriptional regulators. Collectively, the results indicate a role of Zmufo1 in basal endosperm development through maintenance of redox-homeostasis, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation-dependent mechanism.

## Abstract

The identification and characterization of cis-regulatory DNA sequences and how they coordinate responses to developmental and environmental cues is of paramount importance to plant biology. Although thousands of candidate cis-regulatory sequences have been identified in maize, few cis-regulatory elements have been well characterized. We are studying the function of Vgt1, a predicted regulatory element located about 70 kb upstream of the floral repressor gene ZmRap2.7, in more detail. Consistent with a function as enhancer of ZmRap2.7, Vgt1 contains an accessible chromatin region. It however lacks significant enrichment of H3K9ac, a histone modification often observed at active regulatory sequences. Silencing of Vgt1 by RNA-directed DNA methylation results in earlier flowering, and in addition accelerates the growth speed. Expression analysis by RT-qPCR on different leaf areas during plant development indicated ZmRap2.7downregulation in leaf 4 of V3 plants upon silencing of Vgt1. Consistent with the role of ZmRap2.7 in flowering, DNA methylation of Vgt1 resulted in earlier and higher ZCN8, MADS67 and ZMM4 expression in leaves during plant development. RNA-seq analyses confirmed the downregulation of ZmRap2.7 expression in Vgt1 silenced plants. Altogether our data are consistent with Vgt1 acting as enhancer of ZmRap2.7. · Weber et al.

## Abstract

In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is an epigenetic pathway involved in the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. One mutant genotype of maize called mop1-1, deficient in a crucial component of the RdDM pathway, has been used extensively to study the effects of RdDM on different cellular and genetic processes. In other species, chromatin structure has been shown to be associated with mRNA splicing, and some variability in splicing has been observed previously in mop1-1 mutants. It is hypothesized that mop1-1 mutant maize has higher overall splicing variability than wild type. To examine variations in splicing across these genotypes, RNA sequencing data from wild type and mop1-1 maize is being evaluated. Preliminary data using the isoform percentages calculated for specific genes of interest showed many had higher splicing variation in mop1-1 mutants than in wild type. To examine splicing variation in this genotype more broadly, RNA sequence data was run through a program called VaSP, an R package used for quantification of variations in splicing events in a population. This program generates a Single Splicing Strength (3S) score for each intron splicing event based on junction reads and gene-level reads. Preliminary data and current results of the analysis with VaSP will be presented.

## Abstract

Contemporary crop cultivars are the products of selection during domestication, spread, and breeding processes. The focus of recent breeding efforts has been on maximizing yield, though yield is known to trade off with stress tolerance. Our understanding of crop microbiomes and how they may have been shaped by those processes is rudimentary despite their relevance to plant fitness. In natural settings, crop wild ancestors such as Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), the ancestor of maize, rely in part on their microbiomes to tolerate a variety of environmental stresses. We investigated whether the known de-escalation of plant defenses in elite maize cultivars compared to wild and cultivated ancestors is linked to alterations in their microbial communities. We focused on the leaf endosphere and rhizosphere microbiotas of teosinte (Zea spp.) and maize accessions spanning the evolutionary transition from a perennial life history (Zea diploperennis) to annual wild (Balsas teosinte) and domesticated (maize landraces and elite inbreds) life histories. We found that the rhizosphere microbiota of landrace and elite maize cultivars exhibited greater microbial diversity and richness compared to teosintes, whereas we found the opposite in leaf endosphere. Notably, the leaf endosphere harbored more biomarker microbiota than the rhizosphere, and domestication strongly affected both leaf- and root-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, patterns typical of microbial dysbiosis in the leaf endosphere microbial community were coincident with domestication, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. This is the first evidence of dysbiosis associated with crop domestication. Finally, we share preliminary findings on utilizing Balsas teosinte leaf endosphere microbes for developing biopesticides. Understanding the effects of maize domestication, spread, and breeding on the leaf endosphere and rhizosphere microbiota of commercial cultivars is crucial for harnessing teosinte beneficial microbes to develop biocontrol agents and biofertilizers to improve maize resilience to biotic and abiotic stress.

## Abstract

Meiotic recombination involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, playing a key role in evolution and genetic diversity. Meiotic crossovers are not evenly distributed on chromosomes; instead, they are enriched in hotspots controlled by both genetic and epigenetic factors. In maize, meiotic recombination has significantly contributed to its domestication. However, the specific mechanisms of meiotic recombination influencing maize domestication remain largely unexplored. In this study, our objective is to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms orchestrating meiotic recombination during the domestication of maize. Our investigation encompasses a comprehensive range of maize lines, including 5 teosintes, 7 landraces, and 16 cultivars. These lines were selected because they maximize genetic diversity and thus are most likely to show variation for recombination. Currently, we have obtained data from two teosinte lines (BT1 and BT2) and 14 cultivars. Our results reveal significant differences in genetic distance and crossover numbers between the two teosinte lines, indicating wide genetic diversity between them. Moreover, estimation of the recombination rate shows that BT2 recombines at a lower rate compared to BT1, further highlighting the divergence between these two teosinte lines. Comparatively, while one of the teosinte lines displays the highest number of crossovers, the other exhibits the lowest crossover numbers in comparison to the 14 cultivated lines, indicating substantial variations between these groups. Our next step is to complete the analysis of the remaining maize lines and perform further investigations to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in meiotic recombination in maize.

## Abstract

Maize grain moisture dynamics are key determinants of yield, quality, and harvest timing. Genetic factors controlling the developmental transitions from juvenile to adult and vegetative to reproductive phases ultimately govern the onset of drydown. Among these genetic regulators is glossy15 (gl15), best described for its role in the transition from juvenile to adult developmental phases. A panel of diverse maize inbreds was used to identify six functional gl15 haplotypes (A-F), explaining much of the variation in juvenile phase transition among dent corn lines. The prolonged juvenile identity from gl15 overexpression delayed the onset of flowering, impeded drydown, and reduced harvest index. To determine whether early phase transition might improve drydown dynamics, the gl15-H null allele was introgressed into a panel of eighteen North American Yellow Pearl Popcorns and developmental traits were phenotyped, including timing of phase transitions, drydown, and grain quality traits. When the haplotypes of these eighteen accessions were determined through Sanger sequencing, most accessions belonged to two of the six haplotypes identified in dent germplasm. However, a seventh haplotype was identified (G), seemingly unique to popcorn, that delayed juvenile transition and flowering. A broader investigation into the distribution of this haplotype in a popcorn diversity panel revealed that despite occurring in 44% of North American Yellow Pearl Popcorn landraces, no North American Yellow Pearl inbreds carry haplotype G. Similarly, investigation into Latin American Pointed Rice Popcorns revealed that although 71% of landraces possess this haplotype, only 14% of their inbreds carry it. Despite this haplotype appearing entirely absent in dent germplasm and seemingly unique to popcorn, it is present within teosinte, suggesting that popcorn alone maintains genetic diversity once present in the maize ancestor. The changes in haplotype G presence suggest that prolonged juvenility and delayed drydown have been selected against under modern breeding efforts.

## Abstract

Shifting the maize growth cycle by planting earlier in the season can lead to better utilization of sunlight and prolonged land coverage, which in turn helps reduce fertilizer inputs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, increasing seedling cold tolerance is a crucial breeding target for maize cultivation. One strategy to help achieve this goal is the exploration of the existing allelic diversity in the global maize population. We hypothesize that maize lines developed in northern regions and high-altitudes have adaptive alleles for improved fitness in cold conditions, as they have undergone selection for cold tolerance. We make use of 75 high-quality, long-read genome assemblies from diverse global maize accessions, and perform a genome-wide scan to identify signatures of diversifying selection among these accessions. Further, we will explore the functional consequences of identified variants using an evolution-informed machine learning model. Loci identified through these methods are unbiased for the targets of selection. To identify causal variants for cold adaptation, we will conduct an environment-genotype association analysis using measurements of the environment where the lines were developed. Focusing on loci identified as selected and functionally important will reduce false positives, improving our power to detect directly actionable alleles. This study aims to provide valuable insights into maize crop improvement and global agricultural sustainability.

## Abstract

Moquegua Valley in South Peru has an ancient legacy of maize cultivation and colonization preceding European contact. While maize arrived in Peru ~6,600 BP at least partially domesticated, documented movement of maize within the Andes and admixture with Mexican varieties suggests a complicated evolutionary history. Moquegua Valley inhabitants gradually increased cultivation of maize over several thousand years, with more diverse subsistence farming dominating for much of the region’s history. Trade networks were well developed between the peoples of the Valley and the high-altitude regions of the Andes, including the Tiwanaku state. By tracing highland and lowland alleles and studying trait selection over 1,500 years of human occupation, this research provides insight into the co-evolution of humans and maize. We document early maize traits under selection and explore the impacts of Tiwanaku colonization of the Moquegua Valley. Our methodology analyzes ancient DNA from AMS-dated archaeological maize specimens spanning thousands of years to understand how Tiwanaku state colonization influenced maize genomics, advancing our comprehension of the human-maize relationship. Comparisons to modern maize help assess the legacy of these processes within current germplasm. Moreover, broader impacts will empower of local farmers through documentation and curation of diverse regional germplasm, provide educational opportunities through training of undergraduate and graduate students, and establish a meaningful link between the past and the present for future researchers.

## Abstract

Maize's close wild relatives are teosintes, which have a wide ecogeographic distribution in Latinamérica spanning extreme ranges of precipitation and temperatures. The identification of the genetic variants associated with adaptation to such conditions is a necessary step in order to better monitor, conserve and use such diversity in applied projects. Knowledge in the form of sequenced genomes, transcriptomes, and especially loci identified to underpin adaptations to extreme growing conditions, provides a valuable resource for future breeding and in situ conservation projects aimed at providing maize races adapted to the challenges caused by global climate change. As part of our research, our Mexican collaborators performed an extensive teosinte sampling, including approximately 4,000 individuals of 276 populations of all the 7 teosinte species and subspecies distributed in Mexico. These samples were phenotyped in a greenhouse common garden, and genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was applied generating about 30,000 SNPs. We analysed the genetic population structure spanning seven teosinte taxa, phenotypic and eco-geographic variability elucidating relationships between genotype, habitat climate, and phenotype. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was also done to elucidate the genetic basis of various morphological and climatic traits including plant height, plant surface area, number of tillers, the weight of 100 kernels, relative humidity, precipitation, and solar radiation among others. This was achieved using the fixed and random model circulating probability unification model (FarmCPU) and Multiple Loci Mixed Model (MLMM). Our findings highlight significant genetic diversity within teosinte populations, underscoring their adaptive responses to diverse climatic conditions. We identified candidate genes located in or near SNPs associated with these traits. We observed that the genetic loci associated with climatic factors differ across teosinte populations, emphasising the importance of preserving the genetic diversity of all populations. Consequently, our research indicates substantial potential for maize breeding, leveraging the rich genetic diversity within teosinte populations and therefore the importance of preserving the genetic diversity of all populations.

## Abstract

Maize, a cornerstone cereal crop, has witnessed transformative changes through domestication, leading to the depletion of critical adaptive alleles. This genetic bottleneck presents challenges amidst climate change, necessitating the reintroduction of allelic diversity for improved grain yield and quality. This study pioneers innovative breeding strategies that seamlessly integrate conventional and advanced tools to address these challenges. Teosintes, the untamed kin of maize, harbour a reservoir of potential traits, including drought and excess soil moisture stress tolerance, disease resistance, and improved yield and quality characteristics. Focusing on specific teosinte species—Zea mays subsp. parviglumis, Zea mays subsp. mexicana, Zea diploperennis, and Zea nicaraguensis—our aim is to enrich maize germplasm through a holistic breeding approach. Crossbreeding Zea mays subsp. parviglumis with maize lines has revealed Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) responsible for diverse traits, including Banded Leaf Sheath Blight (BLSB), Maydis Leaf Blight (MLB), red flour beetle resistance, high protein content, and alterations in flowering behaviour. Striking characteristics such as multiple ears, a stay-green phenotype, and adaptability for high-density planting have been observed. Exploiting the waterlogging tolerance potential of Zea nicaraguensis, we create populations to map QTLs and genes, developing tolerant lines for integration into the maize breeding program to yield waterlogging-tolerant hybrids. Challenges arise from undesirable genes and alleles in wild teosintes, potentially hampering the efficiency of introgressed lines. To overcome this, an innovative strategy is employed, curbing linkage drag through random mating among backcrossed inbred lines. The integration of in-vivo doubled haploid (DH) technology further expedites allele development and fixation within a short time frame. This synergistic approach, harmonizing the forces of nature and technology, aims to accelerate the domestication of valuable wild alleles. The resultant fortified germplasm holds immense promise for developing climate-resilient maize hybrids, fostering sustainable production, boosting productivity, elevating farmer income, and creating new employment opportunities.

## Abstract

Maize and its wild relatives teosinte can all readily hybridize, yet they remain distinct. Mating incompatibility loci provide one mechanism that can allow populations to maintain reproductive isolation. In Zea mays, three complex mating incompatibility loci encode genes that disrupt directional pollen tube growth down the silk. When a maternal plant receives pollen with incompatible alleles, fertilization is impeded, creating a prezygotic reproductive barrier. However, this barrier is not complete. Infrequent fertilization of incompatible gametes facilitates introgression of incompatibility genes into other populations. Previous modeling shows that each factor should only undergo brief periods of strong selection, on a timescale shorter than time to speciation in this clade. Against this expectation of transient benefit, we find evidence of syntenic gametophytic factor loci across modern maize lines, teosinte subspecies, other members of the Zea genus and Tripsacinae subtribe, and species as diverged as Sorghum bicolor. All of the loci display presence absence variation and copy number variation. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of these complex loci, we classify haplotype diversity at all three loci in over 30 Zea mays genomes, identify syntenic loci in related species, construct gene trees of known and candidate functional genes, and analyze rates of molecular evolution. We find evidence of potentially functional reproductive barrier loci and genes in lineages that have been estimated to be twelve million years diverged. Over millions of years, these genes have undergone selection and evolved to be distinct barriers. We find differences in predicted protein structures that reflect this distinction. We also find evidence of loci driving epigenetic silencing of interacting loci. These loci may have played a role in speciation in Zea.

## Abstract

Early cytological, molecular, genetic, and genomic studies hypothesized maize originated from an allopolyploidy event, due to the presence of duplicated regions throughout the genome. This whole genome duplication occurred 8-13 million years ago, generating the ancestor of both Zea and Tripsacum. Maize has since undergone extensive biased fractionation as it rediploidized, resulting in ten chromosomes. A recent chromosomal-scale genome assembly of Tripsacum confirmed that its 18 chromosomes retain two largely intact syntenic subgenomes, but left questions as to what taxa contributed to the allopolyploidy event. Here, using over 500 newly sequenced species in the tribe Andropogoneae, we reconstruct genome-wide phylogenetic relationships to track this ancestry. Consistent with previous surveys using a handful of nuclear genes, an ancestor of taxa in the subtribe Rhytachninae appears to contribute the subgenome related to M1 that retains more genes. Members of this subtribe today live in wet environments in Africa, including taxa growing in river banks such as Vossia cuspidata (hippo grass), or seasonally swampy environments like Oxyrachis gracillima, Phacelurus gabonensis, and Rhytachne rottboellioides. The other subgenome donor origin is more obscure, with potential contributions from extant subtribe Ratzeburgiinae and genus Elionurus, each of which has a few species present today in the Americas. Where and how this allopolyploidy event occurred is still under investigation. We show that approximately 90% of regions assigned to M1 or M2 based on fractionation are consistent with their phylogenetic origin. Additional analyses are underway to understand how gene conversion events between homeologs may explain the ~10% of regions that disagree. We anticipate this phylogenetic investigation of subgenome ancestry will help maize geneticists interpret the effects of duplicated and fractionated genes within the maize genome. Understanding which subgenome donor is most related to a given maize gene could be of particular utility when considering traits differentiated between these progenitors, such as drought or flooding tolerance and related physiological pathways of cold tolerance.

## Abstract

With the rapidly increasing availability of non-model genomes, methods to scale comparative genomic analyses across hundreds or thousands of species are needed. Along with coding sequence changes, non-coding variation underlies much of phenotypic evolution. We investigated cis-regulatory evolution in an extensive panel of Andropogoneae grass species which encompasses diverse environmental adaptations and numerous tropical-temperate transitions. Species were collected globally and used to generate dozens of long-read assemblies and hundreds of additional short read assemblies. We characterized cis-regulatory evolution across Andropogoneae by comparing occurrences of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs across orthologous promoters, testing the hypothesis that TF networks were similarly re-wired during repeated environmental adaptations. We associated presence-absence variation of promoter motifs with species’ environmental traits, identifying several TF families for which motif occurrence and/or co-occurrence was strongly associated with environmental variables. The most significant TF families show repeated expansions and contractions of their putative regulons as the Andropogoneae diversified and adapted to new environments. Our approach provides a scalable method to identify TF families that may have been central to adaptation over macroevolutionary time scales, nominating candidates for functional validation.

## Abstract

After its emergence in the Middle East around 9.5 million years ago, the Hordeum genus, which includes domesticated barley, spread across the Americas and Eurasia, adapting to diverse climatic conditions. The spread of Hordeum into new environments was accompanied by rapid speciation and ecological diversification. The Hordeum species are thus an interesting clade to study traits and trait complexes underlying ecological diversification, including life-history variation and local adaptation. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic and genetic variation within and between annual and perennial species of the grass genus Hordeum, including the economically important crop barley (H. vulgare L). We trialled 56 annual and perennial Hordeum accessions, comprising 18 species of the Hordeum clade, in a common garden experiment at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany, between the 2021 and 2023 growing seasons. We scored 22 shoot traits at the vegetative and reproductive stages and identified genome-wide genetic variation between and within the species. We tested whether specific climatic variables contributed to phenotypic variation when accounting for geographic distances and phylogenetic structure. Genotype-environment association analyses using redundancy analysis support our hypothesis that local climatic differences contributed to patterns of adaptive divergence among the species across America and Eurasia. Seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation were implicated as primary climatic variables linked to phenotypic variation. We found that variations in plant height, days to flowering, and shoot biomass at harvest are associated with temperature and rainfall seasonality. This study provides insight into genotype-environment interaction and potentially adaptive traits in the Hordeum clade. This work represents a promising starting point for dissecting genetic variation underlying adaptive variation in important life-history traits.

## Abstract

Centromeres are a critical element of eukaryotic genome architecture,serving as the site of kinetochore assembly and responsible for faithful chromosome segregation during cell division. Specialized histones define functional centromeres epigenetically, but tandemly-repeating DNA is associated on the sequence level. In recent studies of T2T assemblies, a close relationship between tandem repeat structure and function was observed in both human and Arabidopsis genomes. Underlying the functional centromere core exists highly-homogenized repeat patterns. Variation in repeat sequence and copy number among and within genetic lines indicate rapid and recurrent evolution on repeats. Here, we utilize 9 HiFi assemblies to investigate both centromeric and neocentromeric repeat structure. Uniquely, maize has four distinct tandem repeats that relate to centromere (CentC, Cent4) and neocentromere (TR1, knob180) activity. Through comparisons among and within genomes, we evaluate how repeat structure relates to function and how individual arrays in conserved positions vary.

## Abstract

Domestication is the process of selecting desirable traits over generations, which are identified by the presence of the domestication syndrome. Traits related to development and reproduction are associated with obvious phenotypes. However, adaptive traits were also selected during domestication, albeit not manifested clearly. Therefore, to trace these hidden traits, genetic diversity was compared between maize genotypes and its wild relative, teosinte. Genetic regions mapping near a reported domestication quantitative trait locus (QTL) were found, encoding genes responsive to heavy metals, such as ZmHMA1 (Zea mays heavy metal ATPase1). This gene exhibited selection signatures in upstream and downstream regions, indicating its involvement in domestication. Promoter analysis further revealed that its promoter region had three protein-binding sites for the transcription factor Tb1, involved in lateral branching formation, a distinctive trait between maize and teosinte. ZmHMA1 belongs to a gene family that employs ATP hydrolysis to actively transport substances inside and outside cells. To elucidate the function of ZmHMA1, wild maize W22 plants, zmhma1 mutant plants, and wild teosinte parviglumis plants were grown in soils with sublethal doses of heavy metals, and phenotypic comparisons were made at all stages of development. Surprisingly, the zmhma1 mutant exhibited vigorous growth and an increased number of seminal roots compared to wild maize, both in the presence and absence of heavy metals. Furthermore, the plants showed constitutive expression of ZmHMA1 throughout development, regardless of the presence of heavy metals. On the other hand, teosinte parviglumis displayed a drastic reduction in lateral branching when grown under high concentrations of heavy metals, resembling a maize phenotype. These results suggest that this gene was affected by domestication, with human selection acting through the regulation pathway of Tb1. Allelic variants in maize reduce the activity of ZmHMA1 compared to teosinte, and exposure to heavy metals could have been a contributing factor to maize domestication

## Abstract

The Andropogoneae tribe contains some of the most productive C4 grasses relevant to agriculture, including maize, Miscanthus, sorghum, and sugar cane and has adapted to a wide host of environments. Notably, while most of these species are perennial, there have been dozens of transitions to an annual life history. Perennials have multiple traits that can be harnessed to confer an advantage to agricultural crops, reducing their environmental impact, such as nitrogen remobilization and freezing tolerance. Many of these favorable traits are hypothesized to have been lost during the transition to annuality. We have previously shown that within orthogroups, annual genes are enriched for reduced sequence conservation and premature stop codons, adding support for the loss-of-function hypothesis during perennial-annual transitions. In this study, we further test this hypothesis by leveraging an expanded set of 533 short read and 38 long read Andropogoneae genomes to investigate the genetic basis of perennial-to-annual transitions across the tribe. This set of genomes allows us to test a greater number of transitions and identify instances of repeated loss of function. Using phylogenetic mixed models, we identified genes associated with perenniality across species. Additionally, we identified orthogroups with differential selection constraint in annuals and perennials. Since it is hypothesized that changes in the environment lead to changes in life history, our models were further expanded to include environmental data to determine environmental associations with the perennial growth habit. These models will provide insight into the ecological niches of perennials and annuals. The results from this research will provide a launching point for future work to understand the adaptive potential of perennials and develop maize varieties that are more perennial-like and better adapted for climate change.

## Abstract

The Illinois Long Term Selection Experiment is the longest-running continuous genetics experiment in higher plants. Over 120 years of artificial selection have generated distinct populations representing the phenotypic extremes of kernel protein concentration in maize. To dissect the regions of the maize genome that have led to the rapid and dramatic responses to phenotypic selection, we have derived four populations of near-isogenic lines from combinations of the Illinois Protein Strains. To aid with the phenotypic evaluation of grain protein concentration, these populations also carried the FLOURY2-RFP reporter gene, a visual marker for alpha-zein accumulation that varies dramatically among the Illinois Protein Strains. Kernel protein concentration was measured using both near-infrared reflectance and pink color intensity of the FLOURY2-RFP reporter transgene. Selection for kernel protein concentration was applied throughout the development of these populations to favor genomic regions with functional effect, but not all introgressions displayed phenotypic deviations from the recurrent parent. This observation does not support an "omnigenetic" architecture for selection response, which posits any genomic region harbors loci influencing a complex quantitative phenotype. Leveraging prior work that identified SNPs with evolutionary patterns strongly correlated with changes in kernel protein concentration, our updated investigations of near-isogenic lines help refine and validate candidate genes contributing to the dynamic evolutionary changes in kernel composition.

## Abstract

Effective crop improvement methods should be developed with knowledge of the genetic basis of adaptive evolution and an understanding of factors that can limit responses to selection. In particular, well-characterized wild relative and crop systems are ideal for exploring the role of introgression on adaptive evolution because alleles associated with phenotypes under selection can be easily attributed to wild vs. cultivated origin. We are characterizing local phenotypic selection pressures on a maize-teosinte hybrid population (SynAdapt) using a multi-generation local adaptation field experiment at Davidson College. For each of five generations, we will measure the growth, survival, pest-damage, and reproductive success of individual plants. We consider selection on focal traits acting through both female (seed number) and male (total tassel length) components of fitness. Lastly, we will conduct a resurrection experiment using seeds from the first and fifth generations to quantify the extent of adaptive evolution that has occurred. This project will yield valuable data that can be used to teach students about the evolution of complex traits and provides opportunities for students to identify the origin of genetic variants (maize vs. teosinte) associated with fitness components and traits under selection.
