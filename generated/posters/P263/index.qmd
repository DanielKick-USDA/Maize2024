The success of a maize breeding program is very associated with the knowledge of genetic diversity (GD) of parental lines. To access GD, new tools such as artificial neural network can provide better results than usual statical methods. Self-organizing maps (SOMs), an unsupervised neural network, can improve the visualization of clustering onto a two-dimension grid. Thus, our objective was to employ SOMs to access the GD in a panel of 182 tropical maize inbred lines evaluated under different N inputs. Over three Brazilian summer seasons, the panel lines was evaluated under two N inputs: high N (HN) with 200 kg ha-1, and low N (LN) with 20 kg ha-1. The lines were laid out in a 13 x 14 alpha lattice incomplete design with three replications. We evaluated 14 traits, including those related to plant architecture and grain yield. To estimate the variance components, mixed model approach considering pedigree information, was employed. Then, the best linear unbiased predictors were used to construct the SOMs. The combined analysis and SOMs were performed across seasons under each N inputs. Notably, we observed reductions up to 30% in mass of thousand grain, grain yield per plant and grain yield under LN. Variance components were statistically significant (P
