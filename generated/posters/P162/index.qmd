Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) have the potential to provide single gene resolution identification of candidate genes in plants and serve as a complement to Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, success in plant TWAS to date has been mixed. We generated a large expression dataset from 693 maize genotypes, measured in a common field experiment, and sampled over a two-hour period to minimize diurnal and environmental effects and using the full-length RNA-seq to maximize the accurate estimation of transcript abundance. TWAS analysis linked roughly ten times as many genes to variation in flowering time as GWAS conducted with the same trait data in the same population. The genes identified by TWAS included known true positive flowering time genes missed by GWAS, genes previously linked to flowering time variation in rice or Arabidopsis, and a modest number of genes without known links to flowering time but with plausible potential mechanisms. TWAS conducted using mature leaf tissue identified known true positive flowering time genes that act in the shoot apical meristem, and flowering time data from new environments beyond the one in which gene expression was profiled enabled the identification of additional flowering time genes. eQTL analysis of TWAS-tagged genes identified at least one additional known maize flowering time gene through trans-eQTL interactions. Collectively these results suggest the gene expression resource we have created can be reused to link genes to functions in determining variation in a range of plant phenotypes scored in diverse environments and expressed in diverse tissue types.
