Leaf angle is a strategic component of plant architecture, and an important area of plant research that interconnects fundamental research on the mechanisms of boundary formation during plant development and agriculture production through improved crop canopy for increased productivity. Due to lack of reliable, automated strategies for measurement in high-throughput, leaf angle has been typically measured on a single leaf per plant in large-scale genetic studies. Several mutations affecting maize leaf angle were cloned and characterized, and genetic and transcriptomic analyses identified additional candidate genes implicated in ligule-auricle development. There remains a huge gap between known developmental genes and their contributions to the natural, phenotypic variation observed in diverse maize accessions. Our analysis has demonstrated that diverse maize inbreds are extremely polymorphic for this “within-plant, leaf angle variation” phenotype. Our overall project goal is to enrich the fundamental understanding of the genetic control of leaf angle variation across the canopy in maize and to provide mechanistic insights into genetic manipulation of plant architecture for continued crop improvement. We are working on four connected aims in this project. Aim 1: Genome-wide identification of genes underlying leaf angle variation across the canopy. This is facilitated by high-throughput phenotyping with a PhenoBot system to quantify multiple leaf angles at different nodes. Aim 2: Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of genes underlying leaf angle variation at two contrasting canopy levels. Aim 3: Functional analyses of genes underlying leaf angle variation through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in maize inbreds with different leaf angle types. Aim 4: Develop educational materials for K-12 teachers to create teaching gardens that help incorporate plant biology content into their curriculum. In addition to cross-training of postdocs and students, we will specifically develop and disseminate grade-level text sets and accompanying seeds for the creation of teaching gardens on school grounds.
