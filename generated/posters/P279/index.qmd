Modeling genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E) remains a challenging yet indispensable aspect of genomic prediction and breeding. Incorporating G×E into genomic prediction models significantly enhances prediction accuracy and guides breeding endeavors towards developing varieties with enhanced adaptability, stability, and performance across diverse environmental conditions, fostering sustainable and resilient agriculture. Within the Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative, the Maize GxE Project has meticulously evaluated over 180,000 field plots encompassing more than 4,500 maize hybrid varieties across 200+ environments in North America. Leveraging genotypic, environmental, and G×E information from this project, our study aimed to predict hybrid maize performance in different environments across the United States. In this pursuit, we introduced the Weighted Records Prediction (WRP) method for genomic prediction. WRP integrates weighted training records into the prediction model based on the precision of Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) and the similarity between the training and testing sets. Employing both linear mixed models and machine learning techniques, we assessed the prediction accuracy of this novel method. Our preliminary results showed WRP might improve the prediction accuracy for hybrid maize grain yield.
