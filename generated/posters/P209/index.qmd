Inadequate absorption of micronutrients, termed “hidden hunger,” impacts more than half of the global population. Those predominately affected rely on staple crops for their caloric intake, which are often low in bioavailability of the micronutrients needed. Iron, zinc, and provitamin A, the predominately lacking micronutrients, have been extensively researched to facilitate biofortification, a plant breeding method that exploits biosynthetic metabolic processes to increase the concentration of nutrient-value components. However, an evaluation for these key value-adding traits has not been thoroughly studied within the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) Project germplasm pool. Whereas commercial hybrid varieties have been selected for high-yielding traits, the exotic donor germplasm utilized by GEM has been historically bred for edible traits, thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering impactful variation for introgression into the corn industry. Two doubled haploid (DH) populations were derived from double-double synthetic crosses to encapsulate the genetic diversity within GEM that represent the two major Corn-Belt heterotic groups. DH lines will be genotyped using a low-density genotype-by sequencing strategy, while double-double cross founder lines will be genotyped using high-density genome sequencing. This approach will allow for imputation with improved accuracies. DH lines will be phenotyped for (1) macromolecular composition using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), (2) provitamin A carotenoid concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), (3) mineral concentrations using inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and (4) antinutrient concentrations for bioavailability assessments. This study will combine genotypic data with phenotypic data in an optimal training populations approach to identify lines superior in value-added traits within GEM.
