The increased genetic load resulting from the cost of domestication and the limited founding parental lines impedes the continuous improvement of U.S. temperate maize germplasm, particularly in the context of climate change. To enhance genetic diversity and mitigate the genetic load, the USDA-funded Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) program aims to leverage tropical alleles for enhancing temperate genetic materials. In this study, we conducted a replicated field experiment under low and high N field conditions over three consecutive years to evaluate the effect of tropical alleles of GEM materials in responding to different nitrogen (N) conditions. From the field experiments, we collected conventional phenotypic traits, including six yield-related and seven belowground root traits, as well as rhizosphere microbial traits from a Backcrossed GEM (BGEM) inbred panel and the hybrids generated by crossing BGEM inbreds with two tester lines, B73 and Mo17. Our results reveal that BGEM hybrids consistently outperform inbreds for conventional phenotypic traits under both N conditions. Interestingly, microbial traits generally display lower abundance and diversity in hybrids than inbreds under high N conditions. However, under low N conditions, about half of the microbial traits exhibit heterosis. To uncover the genetic basis of trait per se, heterosis, and the transformed N-responsive traits, we conducted Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) and identified a number of favorable tropical alleles, some of which contributed to heterosis of conventional or microbial traits and associated with N-responsive traits. The insights gained from this study can potentially contribute to developing N-resilient maize varieties by leveraging host-microbe symbiosis in future maize breeding.
