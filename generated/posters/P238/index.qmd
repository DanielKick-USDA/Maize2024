Maize is one of the largest produced crops and a heavy nitrogen feeder and although it is more nitrogen efficient, excess nitrogen fertilizer application and production has proven to be correlated to increased greenhouse gas emissions for either mineral or organic fertilizers. This leads to contamination of underground water bodies and accounts for 6% of US greenhouse gas emissions that is 55% of agriculture emissions. This figure is however low in Africa but is expected to increase by 2050 due to increasing populations in the region and the need to increase food production. In contrast, Africa needs to increase nitrogen fertilizer inputs by 4-fold, but building healthier soils with higher carbon and nitrogen balance could be key as there is evidence that certain root nitrogen remobilization mechanisms are present in perennial relatives of maize. This research seeks to achieve the remobilization of at least 40% of the nitrogen contained in the upper biomass (stover) to the roots late season to increase the organic nitrogen pool. We will therefore be involved in identifying the genetics involved in the remobilization process by backcrossing an inbred line B73 with Zea diploperennis and tracking nitrogen seasonally. We will then genotype the introgressions to identify their positions within the genome. Complementing these studies, we intend to graft Zea diploperennis with Zea mays roots. We hypothesize that grafting perennial roots to the annual shoot system for gene identification purposes will speed gene identification. Assessment will be done on their stay-green properties and their gene expression profiles analyzed. We hope that results from this study can be used to model the impact of future nitrogen recycling varieties for African agriculture.
