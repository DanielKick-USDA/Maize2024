Genome editing technologies have surged forward in biotechnology, revolutionizing scientific possibilities distinct from conventional genetic modification methods. This research conducts a comparative analysis of regulatory frameworks governing genome editing in Model Countries—England, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Japan—uncovering distinct approaches and developmental trajectories.Utilizing an exhaustive review of legislative mandates, policy guidelines, and scholarly literature, this study highlights regulatory nuances among these five nations. It examines legal structures, ethical considerations, and developmental timelines, emphasizing the growth and diversity in genome editing regulations.Initial findings reveal a spectrum of regulatory approaches, ranging from stringent frameworks necessitating comprehensive risk assessment to adaptable policies fostering innovation and safe utilization. Understanding these variations is vital for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders, aiding informed decision-making and potentially promoting alignment in global regulatory standards.This comparative analysis illuminates the dynamic evolution of genome editing regulations, offering insights into how nations navigate the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of this burgeoning technology.
