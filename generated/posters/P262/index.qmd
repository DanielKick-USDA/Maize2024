Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in cultivated soils, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of major crop species. Studies in controlled conditions have demonstrated the potential of the symbiosis to enhance the growth of host plants. It is difficult, however, to estimate the actual benefit in the field, not least because of the lack of suitable AMF-free controls. Here, we report the use of maize genetic mutants to generate AMF incompatible sentinel plants that can be used as a baseline against which to evaluate the impact of the symbiosis. To estimate the overall (main) effect of AMF and characterize the impact of host genotype on symbiotic outcome, we have selectively incorporated AMF-incompatibility into genetic mapping populations. We are using these populations for trait mapping, estimating AMF, host genotype and host genotype x AMF effects by comparison of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal families. We present evidence of a plant genetic trade-off between performance with and without AMF, indicating the importance of tailoring crop varieties to the AMF “environment”, in the context of different types of agroecosystem. The approaches we present are applicable to other crop species, permit further mechanistic study and are scalable to larger yield trials.
