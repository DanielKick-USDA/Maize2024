Controlling meiotic recombination will allow utilizing larger numbers of allele combinations in breeding programs and make plant breeding more efficient. To do it, we are developing methods to stimulate recombination at specific genome loci. Since meiotic recombination starts with double-strand breaks (DSB) introduced into chromosomal DNA by the SPO11 protein complex, we target the SPO11-1 protein to defined sites in the maize genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In this approach, SPO11-1 fused to a catalytically inactivated dCas9 protein is directed using guide RNAs (gRNAs) to the targeted loci, where it is expected to generate DSBs. Increasing DSB frequencies should lead to higher crossover numbers. To test the efficiency of DSB formation, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation with a DSB repair protein RAD51. To test crossover formation, we utilize a high-throughput pollen typing method, in which sperm cell nuclei are isolated using fluorescence-activated flow sorting and then genotyped with digital droplet PCR. Not all DSBs result in crossovers, depending on factors such as the chromatin state and the level of inter-parental DNA sequence polymorphism. In addition to potential practical applications of this research, we hope to shed light on factors affecting DSB fate.
