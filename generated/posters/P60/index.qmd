Flowering teosinte initiates several small female inflorescences in each leaf axil compared to domesticated maize that produces only a single large one. A major QTL controlling this phenotype, prol1.1, maps to a 2.7 Kb region upstream of the grassy tillers1 (gt1) homeodomain leucine zipper gene known to play a role in repression of tillering and carpel abortion in tassels. Our previous work identified a potential KNOX homeodomain binding site at pro1.1 that was confirmed via ChIP-sequencing using a KNOTTED1 (KN1) antibody. Because KNOX homeodomain proteins are known to dimerize with BLH homeobox proteins, we investigated whether a KNOX/BLH complex could bind to prol1.1. From transcription profiling we discovered that gt1 transcripts are highly downregulated in blh12/14 mutants that are defective in intermediate vein patterning, making the functionally redundant BLH12/14 proteins good candidates to be members of a complex. Furthermore, pull-down experiments indicated that KN1 and BLH12 or BLH14 proteins could physically interact as a complex in vivo. To verify potential binding at prol1.1, ChIP-seq using a BLH14 specific antibody on male and female inflorescence chromatin was done. This confirmed binding of BLH proteins to prol1.1, with a binding peak that overlaps completely with the KN1 peak. Interestingly, GT1 imunolocalization in kn1 or blh12/14 mutant backgrounds revealed reduced expression in axillary meristems, both vegetative and floral. This finding, together with the RNAseq results, indicate that the KNOX/BLH complex functions to activate gt1 in axillary positions where it may function to repress growth. This activation, however, occurs within a window after axillary meristem formation, but before lateral organ initiation as a mechanism to prevent excess branching late in development.
