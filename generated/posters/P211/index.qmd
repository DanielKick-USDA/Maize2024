One way to achieve sustainably high crop yields is by planting cultivars with reduced height. The major beneﬁt of this trait stems largely from the ability of short plants to resist lodging, thereby allowing the adoption of optimal management approaches to maximize yields. The signiﬁcance of the impact that this trait has had on crop productivity is best exempliﬁed by the development of dwarﬁng varieties of wheat and rice in the late ‘60s, which led to an era of food suﬃciency, commonly referred to as Green Revolution. Since then, the dwarﬁng trait has become a staple for most cereal crops. However, there has been one gaping exception. Corn! While it was neither due to the lack of intent nor eﬀort to exploit this trait in corn, dwarﬁng failed to be tamed to generate commercially viable hybrids. The reason: it is not as straightforward as one may think to develop short cultivars in a hybrid crop. A major bottleneck is the lack of a suitable dwarfing trait that should preferably be dominant with negligible impacts of genetic background and heterosis. That said, it is exciting to announce that we have finally found one such mutant that has the potential to transform maize production worldwide. Named D16, it was generated by chemical mutagenesis with EMS. D16 is partially dominant, and it compresses plant height by 2-3 feet in all corn hybrids tested. The impact on yield appears to be positive also. D16 is caused by a unique point mutation that had never been reported in any plant species. D16 can be bred in maize by both conventional and gene editing (GE) approaches. The advantage of GE is that it will allow the D16 trait to be extended to other crops as well.
