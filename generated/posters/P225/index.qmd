A nested factorial mapping population of 1,959 doubled-haploid inbreds across twelve bi-parental populations was used to characterize yield and agronomic performance in the non-Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern. Six parental lines of this population are expired Plant Variety Protection inbreds, which have an important role in the core germplasm of modern proprietary germplasm. The last parent is a public line derived from material released by the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize project. Two hybrid sets were generated using unrelated Stiff Stalk testers as males, PHT69 and FBLL. This study aims to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in elite germplasm under selection for complementary effects and their implications for traits of interest. A genetic analysis was conducted using a multi-parent QTL structure on a multi-environment yield trial grown in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We found a weak correlation between female inbred performance in the two testers, indicating a nonadditive effect for grain yield. Significant QTLs that were specific to testers, across testers, and the difference between testers for various complex traits, such as anthesis and silking, grain moisture, test weight, and grain yield, were identified. Parental allelic effects from the twelve female populations were tester-specific, highlighting the importance of complementarity in hybrid performance.
