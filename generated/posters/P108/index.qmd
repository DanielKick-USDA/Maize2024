Maize leaves comprise a proximal sheath surrounding the stem and a distal, photosynthetic blade. The blade/sheath boundary is demarcated by an epidermal fringe of ligule tissue and the multi-layered auricle, which forms triangular-hinges that create leaf-angle. Leaf-angle describes the bending of the distal blade away from the proximal sheath, a key architectural trait and a target for crop improvement. Multiple components influence leaf-angle, including auricle size, shape and wrapping, as well as the mechanical strength of the midrib. Candidate genes regulating leaf-angle have been identified by genetic, quantitative genetic, and transcriptomic analyses, enabling models of gene regulatory networks. Nonetheless, little is known about the control of leaf-angle variation in the lower-versus-upper canopy of maize plants. Here we describe a systems biology approach combining single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) analysis of the emerging ligule/auricle in lower-canopy and upper-canopy leaves, and dynamic modeling of gene regulatory networks, to probe the mechanism of leaf-angle variation in maize. Three inbred lines (EP1, B104 and B73) were sampled, each of which shows distinct variation in leaf-angle within the canopy. Specifically, upper-leaves have increased leaf-angle (i.e. are flatter) in inbred EP1, but are gradually more upright in inbred B73. In contrast, inbred B104 displays equivalent leaf-angle in the upper and lower canopies. We used single-cell RNAseq to profile the transcriptomic landscapes of early-staged ligule/auricles from the lower (below ear leaf) and upper canopy (above ear leaf) in the three inbred lines. A total of 25 cell-clusters were identified in the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of all scRNAseq samples. Inbred lines showed cell-cluster separation. Comparisons of upper and lower canopy revealed cell-cluster separation within all inbred lines, although the degree of separation is less in B104. Finally, we introduce a dynamic model to systematically describe the mechanisms of maize ligule/auricle development, and its variation in the maize leaf canopy.
