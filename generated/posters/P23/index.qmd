The application of high-throughput sequencing to transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) has enabled significant advances in our understanding of gene expression in plants. The most widely adopted RNA-Seq protocol involves the purification of total cellular RNA, followed by reverse transcription and sequencing. Conventional RNA-Seq suffers some limitations. It reflects the balance between synthesis and degradation of each transcript (“steady-state”) and not its transcription rate in the nucleus. It also lacks the sensitivity to detect unstable and low-abundance RNA species, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To get a better estimate of transcriptional activity, we used the cell-permeable uracil analog, 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) to label nascent RNA of maize B73 root tips in vivo . After ribosomal RNA depletion, the EU-labeled RNA was sequenced, together with the steady-state nuclear RNA and steady-state cellular RNA. The nascent and steady-state cellular RNA profiles were clearly distinct, while the nascent and steady-state nuclear RNA profiles were tightly correlated. About 60% of the expressed genes were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value
