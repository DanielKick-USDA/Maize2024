Stalk lodging severely limits crop yield and causes global annual losses of at least 6 billion USD in Maize (Zea mays L.). The genetic architecture of stalk lodging resistance remains poorly resolved due to 1) a poor understanding of phenotypes contributing to stalk strength and 2) lack of standardized phenotyping approaches to record these intermediate phenotypes. We generated a high-resolution phenome of maize stalks on 40 geometric, structural, and biomechanical phenotypes in a diversity panel, examined the impact of these traits on stalk lodging resistance, and identified underlying loci. Preserving the field location and identity of individual plants revealed substantial intra-plot variation indicating the effect of micro-environment on the phenotypic continuum of the intermediate phenotypes. The single-plant data allowed us to account for spatial effects and increase the accuracy of phenotype data for genetic analyses. Genetic correlations revealed a stronger association of intermediate phenotypes measured on the lower-most elongated internode with stalk flexural stiffness as compared to those measured on the primary ear-bearing internode. Most of the phenotypes under study exhibited low to moderate heritability indicating low genetic tractability and complex genetic inheritance. Multi-trait genome wide association analyses of combinations of different biomechanical, structural, and geometric phenotypes showed candidate genes involved in plant and ear height development, electron transport, membrane structure and transport, oxidoreductase activity, transcription factors, etc. Interestingly, majority of the SNPs identified are associated with the non-coding regions of the genome and certain SNPs are shared between different trait combinations indicating pleiotropic regulation of stalk lodging resistance. Characterizing novel candidate genes and regulatory variation identified in the present study would open avenues for disentangling the genetic architecture of stalk lodging resistance in maize.
