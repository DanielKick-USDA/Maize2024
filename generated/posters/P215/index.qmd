Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is a viral disease caused by host co-infection by maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a potyvirus, such as sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). This disease is most effectively managed by growing MLN resistant varieties, although the relative importance of MCMV versus potyvirus resistance in managing this synergistic disease is poorly characterized. Here, we explore the impact of host resistance to SCMV and/or MCMV infection on plant disease, virus titer, and synergism during co-infection. In addition to visual assessment of disease progress, we used qRT-PCR to quantify relative virus titer and expression of known potyvirus resistance genes TrxH and ABP1. MLN disease was significantly lower in both the MCMV resistant (N211, CML333, and KS23-6) and SCMV resistant (Pa405) inbred lines, compared to the susceptible control Oh28. Only Pa405 sustained resistance to SCMV in both treatments, though both CML333 and KS23-6 had reduced SCMV titer throughout MLN infection. Despite no visible presence of disease, MCMV titers in N211 were not significantly different from susceptible controls by 14 days post inoculation. Initial TrxH expression was up to 49,000-fold lower in Oh28 compared to other genotypes, while expression of ABP1 was up to 4.5-fold lower. Measures of virus synergy indicate that while MCMV resistance is effective in early infection, strong potyvirus resistance is critical for reducing synergist effects of co-infection on MCMV titer. These results emphasize the importance of both potyvirus resistance and MCMV resistance in an effective breeding program for MLN management.
