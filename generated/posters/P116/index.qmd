In order to feed the Earthâ€™s ever-increasing population without compromising its remaining wild areas, agricultural productivity desperately needs to increase. This is especially poignant in cereal crops, which provide the largest source of global calories and yet remain broadly understudied compared to their eudicot relatives. Maximising the yield of these staple crops will require a greater understanding of the networks underpinning their development, including, crucially, the formation and development of their organs; one way to find genes important for such development is through mutant analysis. A fundamental step in organ development is the delineation of the differentiating organ cells (primordium) from the pool of stem cells (meristem) via the formation of a boundary region. Here, we present a new mutant in maize in which this boundary is defective both between primordia and between primordia and the meristem, called fused leaf 1.
