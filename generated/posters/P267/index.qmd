Genomic data is a useful to predict trait values in the large breeding population before field trial, but the decision-making for select favorable individuals is challenging because the breeders often consider multiple traits. Personal experiences and field knowledge are valuable abilities for crop breeding. Thus, advancing “prediction to selection” remains to be important but unresolved. We propose an integrative multi-trait breeding strategy that incorporates trait predictions at the whole plant level to make a cohesive decision for selecting superior candidates via a machine learning algorithm, called Target-Oriented Prioritization (TOP). We found that the likelihood of identifying the valuable one from 300 breeding candidates was 0.3% for an untrained person, also as an impossible mission without breeding experiences. However, we will have the possibility of 60.8% for identification of the valuable one if empowered by TOP algorithm. It provided a potential breeding-decision tool for further moving forward to genomic breeding.
