Modern maize hybrids prolong the period that they photosynthesize and accumulate Nitrogen (N) out of the soil which has helped them produce more yield per unit of N fertilizer. However, the increase in post flowering activity is inversely correlated with N remobilization from the leaves. Further gains in N response could be achieved by breaking this association, but doing so requires an in-depth understanding of the temporal dynamics of maize canopy traits and plant N mobilization. Leaf nutrient samples were collected at five time points and remote sensing phenotypes were extracted from Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) imagery (orthomosiacs and point clouds). Spectral indices and point-cloud based metrics were used to investigate the relationship between changes in N storage dynamics and yield among hybrids grown in low and high N treatments. From these combined phenotypes, it is possible to dissect how rate of growth and canopy health help to describe hybrid response N and also provide clues for how to break the negative relationship between yield and N remobilization.
