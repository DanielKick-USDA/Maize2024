Complex phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation, environmental differences, and genotype-by-environment interactions (G×E). We used field experiments with two levels of the environmental factor soil moisture to identify constitutive and G×E QTL in several mapping populations in maize. To gain a better understanding of gene function and phenotypic effect of these QTL (Woods et al., 2022), we used a functional genetics approach to perturb individual gene models. For each gene model, we searched for loss-of-function mutations within the coding sequence, generated by the insertion of UniformMu transposable elements (McCarty et al., 2005). We created BCF3 lines in order to be able to evaluate root phenotypes of genotypes with alternate homozygous alleles at the target gene models. Measurement of root pulling force (RPF) on plants at silking showed that the mutant line had significantly higher RPF than the wild-type (p < 0.05). The variation in RPF that we observed captured differences in other feature-extracted root traits such as area, depth, and number of root tips. Building on the field-based observations, our hypothesis posits that alternative states at this gene lead to varying signals of nutrient deprivation and supplementation, subsequently influencing distinct patterns of root growth. We aim to characterize and compare gene function, evaluating its impact on root trait variation within mutant and wild-type lines subjected to two levels of factor soil moisture in a growth chamber experiment. Additional functional genetics will be addressed to provide cross-species insights, thereby enhancing our biological knowledge of the genetic architecture that regulates complex root traits.
