Southern leaf blight (SLB), a foliar disease of maize caused by the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus poses a significant threat to maize production globally. Tapping into the host genetic resistance proves to be a potent approach for managing SLB. There have been considerable efforts made towards identifying and elucidating the genes involved in SLB resistance, however, the mechanisms by which these genes operate are often uncertain. The intricate biochemical changes that transpire during plant-pathogen interactions bear significant biological relevance, making metabolomics an ideal tool for in-depth exploration. In this study we are using a set of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL’s) in the genetic background of the B73 inbred line, which are significantly more or less susceptible to SLB than B73 (2 more susceptible, 8 more resistant). The lines were phenotypically screened for SLB in 2019 and 2021 in both infected and uninfected conditions across the growing season. Inoculated and uninoculated samples collected at 2 time points post inoculation from both the seasons were subjected to an untargeted LC-MS/MS. Preliminary principal component analysis indicated a consistent clustering of the biological replicates by genotype, treatment and timepoint, affirming the robustness of the data. Upon SLB infection, we saw a significant upregulation of various amino acids in addition to several metabolites involved in defense related pathways such as the phenylpropanoid pathway in the resistant lines compared to B73. We will further investigate the corresponding uninoculated comparisons and see if such differences are conserved. Through this approach, our aim is to pinpoint metabolites involved in increased SLB resistance. Given our solid knowledge of the genetic framework for resistance in these lines, by combining our metabolomic quantitative trait locus (mQTL) data for the identified metabolites with SLB resistance QTLs, we aim to identify the genetic and biochemical factors contributing to disease resistance.
