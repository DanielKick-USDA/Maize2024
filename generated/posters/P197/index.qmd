Breeding maize for increased grain yield has resulted in substantial changes in plant architecture-related traits, including more upright leaves that decrease mutual shading and provide increased tolerance to higher plant densities, altered plant height via altered numbers of nodes or lengths of internodes, higher harvest index, easier for machine harvest. High-throughput image-based phenotyping of whole plants used in prior studies either sampled destructively or involved greenhouse-grown plants, which may not match field-grown plants’ architectures. During 2021-2023, we have applied AI-driven image processing algorithms to extract multidimensional traits from field-grown plants imaged non-destructively using a Phenobot. Recent improvements to the Phenobot include attaching five tiers of stereo cameras to the Phenobot’s mast at different heights to ensure they capture the same plants' images, simplifying data processing. Custom-made strobe lights, which provide stronger illumination at a lower cost, were added to each stereo camera. Distance-based triggering of camera shutters was employed during the 2023 data collection, reducing the number of duplicate images as compared to our previous time-based triggering method. The Phenobot was used to collect the leaf angle data from the SAM diversity panel. The SAM panel consists of ~380 genotypes, which previous research established exhibit diverse shoot apical meristem traits [1]. Because the entire above-ground plant is derived from the SAM, we anticipated that this diversity in SAM architecture would be reflected in diverse plant architecture. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis. An analysis of a subset of the leaf angles of a subset of the SAM panel reveals diverse leaf angle patterns across genotypes. These patterns of leaf angles match ground truth data collected from destructively sampled plants. The long-term goal of this study is to understand the genetic control of the canopy-related traits and the effects of these traits on the efficiency of light interception by the canopy.
