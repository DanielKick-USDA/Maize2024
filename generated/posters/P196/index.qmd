Free asparagine (Asn) is a critical nitrogen (N) transport and storage compound that can account for a large proportion of the free amino acids in maize kernels. While Asn plays a critical role in plant growth and development, excess N in the grain contributes to environmental problems as excess N in livestock waste can pollute waterways. In addition, when maize is prepared for human consumption, Asn is converted into the probable dietary carcinogen, acrylamide, during the Maillard reaction. For these reasons, we wish to understand the genetic architecture of free Asn asparagine accumulation in maize seeds. Ultimately, we seek to reduce the environmental impact of excess grain nitrogen and improve human health by reducing the precursor to acrylamide. There is genetic variation for both free Asn and protein content in diverse maize. This research aims to identify the genetic determinants of free Asn accumulation in maize seeds using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). Preliminary GWAS studies identified 421 gene regions related to Asn accumulation, while TWAS identified at least 95 genes. Interestingly, there were no overlapping association signals between GWAS and TWAS, suggesting that either different environments yielded variable results or that gene expression is not the only underlying mechanism. Beyond gene identification, we will use RNAi and overexpression of prioritized candidate genes to tease apart Asn metabolism (biosynthesis and degradation) in the plant and the grain. This holistic approach will inform strategies for manipulating Asn levels, balancing environmental sustainability and human health.
