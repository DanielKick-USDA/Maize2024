Hello and welcome to the Maize Meeting demonstration website!

Firstly, please note that this webpage is under construction. It's not clear what presentation will be most effective for this material so we're trying out a few options.

Most pages are accessible from the bar above, but you're encouraged to try the search as well. Here a few things you can take a look at while you're here:

-   Schedule presentation options

    -   Schedule v1 - Responsive tables

    -   Schedule v2 - Static tables (with the option to link to abstracts)

    -   Talks Grid - Not too long to render and allows for filtering (which isn't so critical given that sessions are non-overlapping).

-   Poster listings

    -   Poster List v1 - Tables with brief descriptions

    -   Poster List v2 - Full Abstract Information

    -   Poster Grid - This is time consuming to render but allows for easy filtering.
